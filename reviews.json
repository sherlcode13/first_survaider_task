Here it is...We visited Villagio in the first week of June and to our surprise it had a good occupancy even at the fag end of tourist season.Here is a rating (on 5) to help you evaluate:1. External Housekeeping - 4/52. Food - 4.5/5 (Enjoyed it since it was less spicy and chilly. Decent variety. Good for kids.)3. Amenities - 4/5 (Pool was the most enjoyable. Clean at all times. They do have a small activity room with a TT table, books, billiards table and carom table. Good scope to improve here.)4. Room Housekeeping - 4/55. Service - 3/5 (This was the only hitch during the entire stay. They looked really low on staff in Resto and Room service. It took realllllly long to process orders. It was may be because of the fag end of the season.)6. Staff - 4.5/5 (Very friendly and co-operative right from Security guy to the Manager.) 7. On Campus activities - 3/58. Rooms - 4.5/5 (Rooms were clean, well spaced and lit. We had a pool facing room with two small balconies. Each room comes with a mini bar and a TV connection.)9. Location - 4/5 (It is 10 mins walk from the Betalbatim beach and equally from local market. After 7.30 in the evening the street gets totally isolated and makes it a little insecure walking all by yourself but they say it is very safe and secure.)10. Overall - 4.5/5 (Good experience. Really quiet and peaceful. Away from the noise and hustle.)Betalbatim beach is only 10mins walk from here. This beach is really clean and less crowded, unlike Goa's other popular beaches. So, if you want to enjoy clean waters and fresh air with no nonsense around you, this surely is the beach!\n",

In fact taxi drivers in Batalbatim do not allow other taxis to operate and they do not allow you to self driven taxis also in the area... So that is a kind of Monopoly.

As I got bad experience in this way they have forcefully charged Rs.3000/- for their imported(but it is local made worth around 1000/- to 1500/-) glass by keeping the glass teepoy in a dangerous manner. Also they are charging so many taxes(I don't know whether really paying the taxes to the govt or not) for food in their restaurant and room service. For example if you order for a one litre water bottle in room service it will be around Rs.72/- whereas in their restaurent it was Rs.33/- And the house keeping was very poor in service. also it is far from S.goa and N. goa. Every time we have to use only taxi service which is expensive from their resort and charging monopoly(since no other option To sum up my review this resort is totally unfit for family staySaravanan\n",

We had a good time here since it was calm and the in house facilities such as swimming pool, playing area, etc. were quite good. The best part of the hotel was the room which was huge in size and we luckily got a pool facing room. Also the bathroom is gigantic! Both were nice and clean!

And this particularly applies if you stay at this resort, unless you intend to spend your entire time on the beach in the neighborhood.

And there are excellent shacks too during the season.If you are going off season, and more so as part of a larger group (as I had), it may make sense to take a Breakfast plus dinner package at the resort.

However the room was ok ..It had a reasonable bed separate sitting area a flat screen telly,mini bar and a wetroom.The breakfast was fine with a choice of European and Indian food but we do not recommend eating in the hotel other than that because the food was always stone cold when served and this incudes the room service.The staff were helpful when asked and the standard of cleanliness was fine.The area was more rural than the brochure described with one very limited local restraunt .Do not believe the brochure the beach is a hot 20 minutes walk so we came back by taxi which costing £1 was a good bargin.We did not have a regular rep at the hotel but had a mobile number to contact as and when.We were told the village was walking distance,we actually walked a long way then gave up.This is a very basic hotel fairly near the beach.It was clean with a reasonable breakfast.There s nothing near for the evenings,nowhere decent to eat or to have a drink and certainly no shops.Goa is a long journey you have the expense of the visa,malaria tablets to buy and you have to put up with the awful military airport and the ramshackle transfer bus but when you reach the hotel you expect it to be better than this one was.Goa was wonderful like usual but the hotel was disappointing.\n",

			"review" : "\nDont Judge the Book by its cover - Very True for \"Goa Villagio Inn\". This popular proverb is very true in case of this place. Being a sterling member we booked this place with lots of hope. But the instances will give you a true picture of what it is and how they treat their guests.Some points to highlight:1. Ambience: Fair2. Front Desk Staff Behaviour: Poor. Specially the resort manager Ms. Irene. The entire staff was not able to speak in front of her like she is not running a hotel but a military hostel.3. Check-in: Extremely Poor, they took 3 hours to allot a room inspite of having confirmed booking 3 months in advance. We reached there from Karwar at 8pm and informed the resort twice that we will be reaching by late evening. By 9pm we were given a room no 404 and in just 30 mins we got a call stating that eigher we change the room or ele we need to pay Rs 600/day extra. Later they reduced the same to Rs 250/day. We dont know when we hada booking 90 days in advance andwe were pre-booked then why 404 was allotted and they why we were threntended to pay extra. After getting exhausted for entire day in site seeing and driving once reaches the hotel to take rest and enjoy, instead we were not able to go to bed till 11pm.4. Front Office/ Reception: The receiption is NON-AC and in summers when a guest travelling with 2 small kids is asked to sit for hours for alloting a room in heat, you can visulaize what it will be.5. Billing: We booked a 3 beded room, but we were asked to pay for extra bed as the 3 beded room was not available in the category we had booked. What is the use of prior booking if they can't block the room for the booking they had already done in advance.6. Room Linen: Not a tall clea, has lot of oil stains.7. Facilities:  - No lifts in the resort. Difficult for family and elderly people.  - Swimming pool was under maintenance for the entire week and every day they use to say it will be fixed today. Why can't they have courage to say it will be out of order for the next 10 days or so.  - No first Aid box: We needed the first aid box as my younger kid had abrasions from the visit to the beach and there were no medical store nearby so we asked from the front desk but we couldn't get that as the staff was most unresponsive. - We wanted coffee sachets in place of tea bags, but we were asked to pay extra @ 15rs per sachet as it was there policy to provide 2 tea bags and 2 coffee sachets. We simply asked to replace the tea bags with coffee as we dont drint tea but they simply refused and asked to pay for such exchange.Finally its not a resort which they claim to be. Will never visit this prioperty again!!\n",

It was built to be sold as apartments to willing owners that didn't happen. Then Sterling leased it and are running it as a so called resort. It is too small to be called that.And now Sterling has started a grossly unethical practice of refusing booking to genuine Timeshare Owners while letting it out en bloc to non-Timeshare owners - mostly Russians.They lie to timeshare owners constantly about \"non-availability\" of accommodation even 90 days before planned stay (when they open bookings). Despite their constantly saying that the resort is \"fully booked\", one could easily find rooms through travel websites - albeit at a huge premium. Sterling is shoving all Timeshare owners to north Goa - 50 Km away while they lease out the very owners' rooms at Villagio (in South Goa) to casual guests.Sterling Holidays' website says: \"All resorts in the Sterling Holidays network also have specially designed hotel blocks for the comfort and convenience of guests who prefer to vacation as a one-time hotel guest.\" There could not be a greater LIE! And now, they take a step forward to completely deprive genuine timeshare owners and run Villagio totally as a hotel. Why then do they call themselves as a vacation timeshare company and not a hotelier? This link will explain it better. fb.me/2rimPlJOR\n",

We were impressed with the staff both at the reception counter and in the dining room. The warmth that is so typical of all Sterling Holiday Resorts is something that we have never experienced elsewhere. The rooms are good, amenities are great, the ambience is also good and the food is a delight. We did not eat too often in the resort restaurant as we were told not to miss the food at Martin's Corner and we truly had a treat each time we visited Martin's Corner. However, it would be unfair not to appreciate the a la carte dishes we had at Villagio, particularly the Grilled Chicken with steamed vegetables and french fries and the Grilled King fish with steamed vegetables as well as the American Breakfast. The service by the boys Godfrey, Remedias, Santosh and Francis made meal time all the more enjoyable with the Executive Chef, Binish also keeping us company off and on. The care taken by the girls at the reception counter only added to the memorable stay we've had. In particular, mention must be made of Saswati, Neelu and Aslina who did all they could to ensure our comfort.

Every one at this resort was ready to go an extra mile and help us in all possible ways. Pool was clean as my children enjoyed it a lot. Food was also very delicious. Near by beach Betalbatim was clean and peaceful and was like a virgin beach with life guards.Enjoyed the Villagio -Keep it up ......\n",

			"review" : "\nWe went to spend holidays at Goa Villagio from 10 April to 13 April 2013. We reached Goa at 5 AM at Madgaon Railway Station. From there we booked a Pre-Paid Taxi to Sterling Goa Villagio Hotel. They charged us Rs 450. We reached hotel within 30 mins and our Check - in was quite smooth. Other than utility charges we have to pay heavy Rs 600 as luxury tax. Our room was at 3rd floor. There are no lifts in the hotel so better you take lower floor rooms otherwise have to walk up the floor.After rest we went for a walk to see around. There is nice beach called Betalbatim very near with 10 mins walking distance. Beach was clean and less crowded as well. Being on west side you can see the sunset there. Then we came back to our hotel and enquired about Sight Seeing. Travel Desk staff told that because of the Taxi Union you yourself have to talk to them for pay and all. These people are standing with their taxis right infront of the hotel. You can either go for taxi or you can go for rent a scooter. There are 2 trips like North Goa and South Goa. For North Goa visit amount is Rs 2300 with 4-5 places of visit and for South Goa you have to shell out Rs 2100. Both trips include 2-3 Beach visits as well so it was just go and see. No time to enjoy equally in all the beached. Fort Aguada , Dona Paula, St Francis Church and Dolphin Trip was great. There are 2-3 temples also. If you are going in April around don't forget to take sunscreen lotion and temperature reached 35-36 degrees at Noon.Coming to Sterling Villagio - Its a small hotel with different towers containing 4 rooms at each floor. Food Masti Package was worth and usually buffet was provided near to swimming pool. IPL Matches were also projected on wall during these days and this time they offered 20% discount as Happy Hour at Bar. Overall it was good and relaxing vacation with supportive staff.During checkouts no one asked about our feedback/recommendations of our stay as asked usually by all Sterling Hotels. Rest was all good\n",

			"review" : "\nWe booked this hotel by viewing feedbacks in trip advisor. But it was terribally went wrong from day one of stay. Firstly hotel is located in betalbatim which is at least 25 km away from most of the sight seeing spots and happening places in goa. If I had to summarise our stay there then it's like saying in so called 5 star facility of sterling in the village of goa. Location of the hotel was so poor that there is no good food facility in near by so naturally u have to depend on hotel food unless u plan to visit north goa every day.(so why not stay in north only). Hotel did not provide facility for driver for accommodation. Even they don't allow him to access washrooms. They expect us to buy him room round. Which is really pathetic.We opted for three course buffet menus as ala catere food seems to be in US dollar currency converted Indian rupees. We had food for 3 days but everyday menus was almost same. Even breakfast menus was not so great.Room cleanliness was there but no buckets in bathrooms. So they expect everyone to take showers. Window panes were reflecting from outside with non visibility. Curtains had two rods but only one curtain.So in short we recommend to stay away from this hotel unless u want to experience calm stay and not much goody persons.\n",

			"review" : "\nWe spent six nights recently with two couple friends (Two studio apartments, pool facing. One first floor rear facing) had a great experience and would highly recommend the property. A must do place.Here's my two bit from our experience:Rooms:Pool facing rooms on the ground floor truly a treat (404/403). Great view, no balcony but hardly a deal breaker unless you are a smoker. Adequately large rooms (did yoga in-room daily), Beds were very soft ask housekeeping to firm them up a bit. Better mattresses would go a long way in completing the positive experience. Pillows were, average to good. Air conditioner, worked just great as did the mini fridge.Bathrooms were well appointed and large. Had all the essentials in place and functional. For some weird reason there was actually no partition between the shower area and rest of the bathroom, just a level difference of 10mm. No shower curtains!! And No, no tub either. You land up wetting half the bathroom, including the pot, but hey, you have housekeeping.Only concern (at least when we were there, 2nd to 3rd week of April) were the mosquitoes. We had housekeeping keep them at bay by spraying bug spray twice daily. Also request the executioner, Mr Santosh to zap them to oblivion.Food:There is one multi cuisine restaurant and an outdoor al fresco type sitting arrangement with a bar on the far end. Daily buffet is also available. Morning egg station is a hit (after I showed them how to make Spanish omelettes). Vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes in reasonable numbers, good for a four day stay. In general food is strictly average, but the service and willingness to provide makes up big time. Per portion pricing is on the higher side, but portion sizes are generous.Recreation:Tiny kiddie and an average sized adult swimming pool lined with recliners on one side, great place to catch up on a book.Recreation room (Board games, odd kids’ toys, carrom, table tennis, PC games, Wii and a pool table) a bit cramped but will keep kids occupied for a couple of hours.Location:If you enjoy the beach, this is the place. Ten minutes walking distance to the Betalbatim beach. The beach itself is clean and not commercialized as the popular ones. You get a lot of space to do your thing. Recliners, shacks and life guard, all in place for a great sunset or sunrise dip.Down side:They need to throw in free WiFi. Internet cost is a rip-off! Distance from most happening night life places. Make no mistake, without a car/cab your mobility is severely restricted. Cabs are expensive so factor in INR 1600/- a day to hire one for 8hours / 80 Kms. Must do things:Thallasa at Vagator for sunset and Greek food with lots of Sangrias. Fisherman's Wharf, Cavelossim, for on the river experience.Check out the vaious flea markets.\n",

We had stayed in sterling from 12 to 14 and 18 to 19 march in a studio room which the resort people called deluxe suit room, was big enough, comfortable and clean. hotel staff is very helping and caring. miss roopali and Mr. manjunath on reception are very helpful. they allow us to late checkout on the last day of our trip as our flight timing were about 5.30.Pool was good and highlighting the beauty of the resort. most of the guest in resort were foreigners. we took food masti package which is around Rs.575 per person + tax for breakfast & dinner which was quite reasonable in concern of Goa. breakfast was good but dinner was not for Indian guest. as we are vegetarian we find less options for us. you should include few vegetarian Chinese dishes in your buffet dinner menu.i want to give suggestion to the sterling people at Chennai office that they should inform in their resorts if they launch any offer. like when we book our holiday they told us if we pay utility charges (only member has to pay) in advance they will give 5% discount on that but when we reached, resort people were not aware about that. as you provide 2 mineral water bottle per day ,you should provide complimentary internet service at least 30 min. per day or charge nominal cost. you people charge Rs.100 for 1 hour which is not reasonable at all. we deposited our utility charges with taxes at Chennai office and as per our confirmation voucher no dues were pending towards anything but while we checked inn resort people introduced govt. of Goa luxury tax which was Rs. 100 per day per room, which was like an harassment because we already deposited all taxes and utility charges at Chennai office. resort location is far away from main tourist location like benaulim and colva beach but we didn't find any problem as we hire Honda activa scooter at Rs. 200 per day cost in front of the hotel. overall good experience and finally on the last day of our trip \"Manjunath\" smiles.\n",

			"review" : "\nMy wife and I stayed at the Sterling Villagio for six nights at the end of our second three week independent holiday in Goa and while we were able to find faults they were balanced out by the enthusiasm o f the staff, the spaciousness of the hotel and rooms and the quietness.It is pretty much out on a limb as far as doing things in the evening are concerned unless you wish to walk to the beach to eat and watch the sunset. We never ate at any of the shacks – like the hotel mainly frequented by Russians - which we felt lacked the warmth we experienced at other resorts such as Palolem, Patnem and Cavelossim. Also during our stay the patio outside the hotel restaurant was being re-laid so there was no outside dining for four nights and meals including breakfast were taken in the banqueting suite which was soulless. But to be fair this should not be a problem in the future because our assessment of the restaurant ambiance as “fair” caused consternation all round and we were immediately sought out by the manageress who persuaded us to change it to “good” because, one assumes, head office would kick up a fuss, although it was not their fault the area was being dug up when we arrived. That also gave us the opportunity to complain about the rate offered on travellers’ cheques which was a derisory 72 rupees to £ sterling, against 82 along coast. No doubt they hope to get away with this rate because they have a captive audience – the nearest place to exchange money is Colva, a taxi ride away. The cost too of wi-fi – provided free of charge by all the other hotels we used – was ridiculous. We were quoted the equivalent of £30 for a five day connection which was really taking the mickey.During the day it is well worth walking north along the beach to Majorda. But I would advise you to ignore the stroll the other way to Colva which is a dump and must boast the world’s grimmest public toilet. But this sort of thing goes hand in hand with the garbage which is to be found almost everywhere you go in Goa and which the authorities appear to be reluctant to do anything about. You cannot help but fear the state will eventually take on the appearance of a giant, unregulated landfill site unless they get a grip.We used the hotel’s room service on one occasion which was very good and on other occasions dined at three restaurants, each in the same area about a 35 minute walk away which can be dodgy in the dark.We took a taxi from the hotel to them - Camron, Fishka and Martin’s Corner - which cost 400 rupees return and the driver hangs about for you. All three are recommended and you get a free Wi-Fi link in Camron and Fishka while you can observe how the other half (Russians) live as they order giant crabs, lobsters etc and copious amounts of expensive wine (sorry about the envious tone).By all means stay at the Villagio but I think our six nights were just about enough. I sense a two week package might be tedious.\n",

			"review" : "\nWe stayed at the Villagio Inn, during August 2012, booked using Sterling Holidays. I have to compliment Sterling Holidays for their excellent service. The resort was better than I expected and special mention to all the staff who made our stay into a memorable vacation. Villagio Inn gave us an upgraded room and that was a wonderful gesture. The rooms are clean, well maintained. Kids had a nice time at the recreation room (albeit it was a bit small). The swimming pool was quite deep even at the shallow side and the resort did not provide any 'floaters' etc.There are no lifeguards on duty. A couple of rubber floaters could have really made the difference to those who want to enjoy the pool, but, don't know how to swim. Food choices are limited, but, we did enjoy the package deal (B/F + dinner). Restaurant options are limited near the resort unless you have a car / bike to commute. The biggest disadvantage of the location is commuting and the presence of the taxi \"mafia\" near the hotel. They fleece you like hell and you cannot hire any other taxi from anywhere else in town because these guys create problems. I found my solution thru' one of the reviews written on Tripadvisor, wherein a telephone contact of one Mr. Joseph is mentioned. His shop (Kims Collections) is located 5 mins from the resort, at the Betalbatim market. He is a very heplful person and rents cars/bikes to tourists. Thanks to Mr. Joseph, we hired 2 cars are self drove around Goa. It was fascinating and he was very helpful in providing us with directions and assistance at every stage. Betalbatim beach is very clean and not too crowded and it is just a 10 min walk from the hotel. To sum it up, we had a very enjoyable stay and spent quality family time at the Villagio.\n",

The receptionist, Roopali, accompanied us to our room and patiently explained about the amenities available and what amenities were charged and what were complimentary. We got the room with two balconies, one balcony was facing the garden and the other was facing a building within the property. The garden view was good.The room service was very prompt. It never took more than 5 min for our requests to be attended by the staff. The 1st day, we noticed that the remote's batteries were down. We called house keeping and batteries were replaced in hardly 5min. The food was very tasty though it was a little expensive. If you can't find the dish of your choice, you can ask the chef to make it for you :D. The bar was also very good. The room was cleaned and the sheets were changed every day. The beers in mini bar were nominally priced. Bathroom was very spacious and clean. Complimentary bathroom accessories like shower gel, hand wash, shampoo were provided and these were very good. There is clothes line in bathroom, so we didnot have problem drying our clothes.The room was very spacious and very clean. There is an electric kettle with complimentary coffee, tea and milk powder sachets. These sachets are given every day but extra sachets are charged nominally. If you drink herbal teas or green tea, you can easily make with the kettle given. There is an electric safety locker in the ward robe. You can set your own password or use credit card as key. The mini fridge was working properly unlike in our previous hotel. The LCD showed all major Indian channels and few foreign channels too. HDFC ATM was near hotel and is just 2 min drive. There is also a weighing machine in room :P. The staff was very patient and helpful. We once had a little problem with the shower. The water was too hot. We called the house keeping and it was attended to immediately. With in 10 min, the problem was solved. Also, in the final bill, one extra beer and extra food charges were included. The girl at the reception, Monisha, promptly attended to this and these were removed from the bill. I read in several reviews about power cuts in monsoons. There were power cuts here too but power was restored within few seconds.The pool was well maintained. There are indoor games like carroms, chess, PSP, table tennis etc in the hotel. It also has toys for kids. The day we were checking out, there were 28 check-outs. But despite this, our check-out was smooth and hassle-free.Just be a little careful when using the bikes provided at the hotel. They arenot maintained properly. So it is better that you carry your driving license and get a bike from elsewhere. Also, the place has no elevator. So be careful to book ground floor rooms if there are any old people accompanying you.Albert's Place is very near and great food is served there. The guy there, Irfan, is very friendly.On the whole, I loved my stay here and would definitely come back again.\n",

Location of the resort is very good and is about 25 mins from Madgaon Railway Station, we came by a cab and the cab charged us Rs.450/= to drop us there (I bargained with them they were asking for 500). We were 4 Adults and 2 Kids . The Betalbatim Beach is just 10 mins walking distance it is a nice clean and scarsely populated beach (Just what we wanted). The Resort is just recently developed so the rooms are brand new and very spacious, equipped with A/c and Tea & Coffe Maker, also they had provided a Digital locker in the wardrobe and many other small small things which might be useful during our stay. Room service was a bit slow but that was ok we were never in a hurry. Overall, it is a beautiful property and the swimming pool was clean and most enjoyable and they have Holiday activity room also where in you could play carrom, chess, Table Tennis & many other games so the kids can have a great time. Staff is very co-operative and helpful and the North Indian veg food in the restaurant \"Pebbles & Sand\" we had was awesome and very tasty. It was a rainy day when we arrived in Goa and it continuously rained heavily for 2 days but the other 2 days were sunny. We did not want the guided tour provided by the Cabbies at the resort so I checked with the resort people for a self driven car but they discouraged me as the cabbies union people would fight with them so they suggested me to check at the nearby market so then I went walking down to the nearest Betalbatim Market which was 10 mins away from the Resort and enquired about a self driven car on rent, I could manage to get Maruti Sx4 on hire for Rs. 1200 per day from Mr. Joseph Cota - 9850477357, it was a brand new car and we used it to roam around for 2 days. We went to North Goa and also moved around in the South Goa. Getting a self driven car in Goa is hassle free but you have to be equipped with GPS and road map in order to move around there other wise you can end up losing all your time in finding places. Since we had the car we could go to calangute beach, Baga Beach, Fort Aguada, Miramar Beach, Anjuna Beach, Dona Paula Beach, Colva Beach, Taj Exotica, Gandhi Market - Margao, Majorda Beach, Benaulim Beach. We went to the Taj Exotica, its a lovely property they have and they easily let you go in for a stroll, there are no restrictions you can also go to their private beach and move around, they have a kids area where in the kids can play in the park and also there are computer games which they can play (Everything is free with out being a room guest. You can move around as much as you want.) Overall, It was total fun and enjoyment in Sterling and in Goa.\n",

This hotel is just 15 Minutes drive from Madgaon railway station, around INR 400 by Prepaid Cab from the station itself. Its nicely tucked away in the south goan countryside, accompanied by Betalbatim beach (5-7 Mins Walk), Albert's Place-Nice Goan Restaurant (2Mins) and Seawaves Shack on the beach; Thats it! It is nicely hidden away amidsts Coconut palm trees and Farm Fields.The rooms are decent as well, We stayed at Luxury Suite. The suite was pretty big and well furnished. The housekeeping was very active and they cleaned our rooms at regular intervals and got us things that we wanted in a jiffy. The hotel also has a nice clean pool with Sundeck and Gazebos; and yes! you can also order drinks at the poolside. Do order a Yellowtail White Wine at the poolside, its superrrb.Breakfasts was nicely spread and Fresh.My stay at this hotel met my expectations and would like to stay here if in south goa.\n",

The team at the resort starting with Sajith, Monisha, the other ever smiling girl at the reception & the activities lady, Chef Hussain & the list goes on have always a smile on their face & ever ready to help. The Masti Dining package seemed to be good enough. Variety may be improved on that front. The resort was well maintaned, rooms were clean & crisp. My Kid still speak about the auntys who gave them flowers & cake for the birthday :)KudosKEEP UP THE WONDERFUL JOBSome improvements suggested would be as follows->Sign boards are a MUST MUST MUST- Kept shuttling atleast 2 times past the resort.>Booking voucher to carry a contact mobile number in case of emergency when land lines are down(was the case the day i checked in)>Service at peak times needs to be better monitored ( in the restaurant) though must mention the refilling of the buffet was just superb.>Curtains in the rooms are smaller than the door/ windows- needs to be altered or changed.>Eye for detail can be improved- Just to give an example- The day I checked in the A/C remote batteries werent working & we really ran around to control the temperature.\n",

			"review" : "\nIam a member of sterling holiday resorts stayed in sterling villagio during the course of last week of May. To my surprise the resort is very well maintained, the service was really very good, we have to take 10 minutes walk if we need to go to beach, the beach is very good with safe zone and watch guards on duty. The main area of Goa Calancut beach, Anjuna beach and other tourist spots are very far away, which is around 40 kms from this place. It costs around 2000 by taxi during off season, I was told in season it used to be 2.5K to 3k. Thier breakfast buffet is not that great, there is no idly or dosa only sambar was available. Their lunch buffet or dinner buffet costs 450+ is not that great. The only flip side of sterling holiday resorts is their food bill. It costs at least minimum of 350 to 450 for a Non veg if u are ordering from their menu card. Per session it costed me not less than 2500 for my family of four.I suggest sterling to drop at least 30% on their food bill. Reg. the quality of the food i would say its really outstanding but the quantity doesnt justify the price they ask for. A King fish costs around Rs.450 but you get two small pieces. I hope sterling listens to this. Except the expensive food bill every thing is great in Sterling. One small note for sterling holiday management reg. thier swim pool. The swim pool depth starts from 5 ft and ends up with 8 ft. It will be very difficult for the tourist to use such a deep pool. Especially ladies will find it very very difficult to use this pool. I would request sterling to start from 4ft to 6.5 ft max.\n",

So if you want to stay here, either you must have your own vehicle or be willing to walk about 3-4 km to and fro for anything that you'd like to do. Two, our room over looked a broken down street and that's not what you're looking for in Goa. Their deluxe rooms with a view overlook the pool and that's the best that they have.

We have been to many resorts in Goa but we think that Betalbatim is the nicest.The hotel is in a perfect location - 5 to 10 minutes to the beautiful beach but also in the middle of some gorgeous countryside. We spent many a happy hour walking down to Colva and Benaulim and up to Majorda along the beach, but also along the lovely and very quiet country lanes. There is a beautiful lake a couple of minutes from the hotel and there were always interesting birds there.The hotel is quite new and we had a nice room overlooking the pool.The fact that there is a living-room separate to the bedroom is a nice feature. The bathroom was very modern, much nicer than a lot we have had. There are 2 balconies and this is the only gripe I have about the hotel - why are there no table and chairs on either of them? We love sitting out in the evening before going out to eat,so of course, this was not possible.Breakfast was fine, but we did not have any other meals in the hotel because of the proximity of the wonderful Alberts restaurant, and all the very good beach shacks, particularly Little Palms.The pool and surrounding area was very clean, and the gardens beautifully maintained.Finally, the staff were very friendly and efficient, and we would not hesitate about going there again - we found the hotel to be very good value considering the location and facilities.\n",

The resort does not have any lift which is ok as it may be a Go Green initiative. But then the booking staff has to take care that they look at the visitor’s details and book rooms accordingly. E.g. we were accompanied by my mother in law (Age 75) & we were allotted 4th floor room. On request, we were told that only one room is available. With no choice, we changed to a ground floor room, which was at the end of the property. This room had a continuous stink of drainage as there were drainage outlets nearby. Also, there was a big generator noise as the generator was located just outside the room.b. On scrutiny, we also realized that there were similar category rooms which were empty in the resort which they could have easily allotted to us.c. Staff/service a bit is lax. The staff has to be reminded once at least to bring the things like towel, soaps etc.d. I had 2 very bad instances: a. I was taken aback by one response of the staff where they mentioned that there is a charge of Rs100 per plate (so total Rs 400=100*4) to provide 4 empty plates in the room. This was an attempt to force me to purchase the dinner in hotel which happened to be a Goa Carnival day & priced at 1500 per couple. b. When asked to replenish the tea packets that are provided complimentary, the staff refused to get tea packets instead of coffee packets. Later on they did provide us with extra packets.e. Also when we became a time share member way back in nineties, it was promised that the resorts will have accommodation with kitchenette & cooking facilities/utensils. The resorts which I had visited earlier like Munnar, Kodaikanal etc did have those facilities. However the new resorts Sterling Holidays seem to have given away this concept? Areas of improvement:a. The resort does not have any play area for children (outdoor games) except some play station games which are off course chargeable. b. Resort reservations should be online real-time system. The time share members should be given an access to the same & book online. The current system of sending a mail with 3 options of location & dates and getting the response after 2 days is time consuming & redundant. Also increase the call center support, as it takes lot of efforts to go through the same, as it takes lot of efforts to go through the same and actually getting the response.\n",

Our experience with Sterling resort was totally a let down (Lonavala property) and hence we didnt had much expectations from this property. We chose this for our stay only coz we happened to be Sterling members. But then the property was really amazing and we enjoyed our stay very much. This is a 300 rupees drive from Madgaon railway station and 600 rupees drive to airport. There are no sign boards and hence we had to let our cab driver speak with the hotel reception. But then you can look for Nanu Resorts board and follow it. Villagio Inn comes just before Nanu Resorts. The rooms and very spacious and well kept. The staffs also are very helpful and friendly. They will arrange bikes for us if we want to roam around at a charge of 300 for a full day. (we can return it by 9pm). They have an excellent swimming pool which we can make use of. Food was also good though it was slightly costly, but then with so much shacks around food was never a problem. The nearest beach is Betlabatim beach which is at a walkable distance. The beach was not at all crowded and has a very decent crowd. It is ideal for family and those who wants to spend some nice quiet time. Other places near by are Colva beach, Margaon town, Spice plantation and so on.North goa is around 60 kms from the hotel. Cabs are readily available and they will charge you 2500rs for a day. Overall the experience was quiet nice and we really had wonderful time!\n",

			"review" : "\nBetalbetim is only a short transfer and is ideal for people who do not want the hustle and bustle of North Goa. A short walk to the beach, the Villagio Inn, run by the Sterling Group can offer a middle of the road destination if you like eggs everyday for breakfast. No clean towels and insufficiently cleaned rooms, overflowing drains, which gave an unattractive aroma. After several complaints the hotel management, which were very slow to react to the concerns made some small attempts to rectify things, which ranged from lack of variety for breakfast, no bottled water, no clean cups, no fresh towels; as the room service made swans features on the bed while watching TV. After trying to displace us at 10am on the morning of our last day (checkout), as international check out is midday! The only facility available after this time was a cold shower, which my five year old didn’t appreciate as we had a long wait at the airport and 10.5 hrs flight home. The reaction of the hotel management to the concerns was very poor and mixed as some people seemed to get far more attentive treatment then others. Maybe it’s a little bit of “he who shouts the loudest” If you want to take a motorbike from outside the hotel then don’t pay more than 500 inr at the height of the season or 300 inr at low. You will enjoy the thrill of the open roads and you can get about relevantly cheaply. Mind the speed bumps and other travellers as there is no etiquette on the roads. The trips organised by the Hotel Reps are expensive and can all be duplicated by the local taxi drivers, who all speak fantastic English and can be hired all day for very little, 50 inr per hour (waiting for you to finish your excursions or shopping). Betalbetim beach is about 10 mins walk down the road from the hotel. It is fairly quiet in comparison to some of the other beaches in Goa. It has plenty of shacks or temporary eateries on the beach. Sea Waves restaurant, run by John and Simon and their wives is great. A family run establishment with great food at a good price. Zeebop, (beach shack), a little up the coast from Betalbetim in Majorda, is set off the beach a little. This is a great seafood lovers paradise. Albert’s, just down the road (you’ll pass it on the way to the beach) is also a good place to eat. Nanu Beach Resort can be accessed for meals, and has nightly entertainment, a little cheesy, but kids love it. However, Martins Corner, about 30 minutes walk or a 10 min drive from the hotel isn’t a great place to eat. The service was particularly dreadful . Having kept is waiting far too long for drinks and food and when the food and drinks arrived, it was awful. . If you want to travel around then haggle your taxi driver, to get a good price. Indian gold is also good value if you go to Margao and you must try the little packets of peanut balls, sold in the local shops, if you are trying to satisfy your sweet tooth. Colva Beach can get very busy, just a short 20 min walk down the beach from Betalbetim . It can get very busy with day trippers. Remember Sundays can get a little busy at the beach as it is a day of rest for everyone. The Waterfall trip is a nice contrast from the towns, set in the Wildlife reserve. You get in a jeep and head up into the hills, a bone shaking journey. Once out of the jeep you can feed the Monkeys, (don't read the signs on teh way up!) Take some bananas for the monkeys, but hold them tight. If you buy them at the start of your trip you’ll pay more. You can swim in the Waterfall, but remember the water is very cold. Going to see the elephants was also a great day out. You can get up close and personal, very impressive. If you have the time and money you can wash, swin and ride to your hearts content. Try and get out and about early, you'll see much more of the day as it can become a little uncomfortable in the midday heat. A great winter destination that will appeal to all, even if you have young children as it is a very friendly place, a little too friendly at times, but try and enjoy the cultural differences of Goa and look beyond the lack of infrastructure. Goa holds a great deal of charm. Local people are very helpful and always happy to help. Take a torch with you at night as the roadside lighting is not the best and some off the beat roads are not illuminated. It maybe an expensive flight but the cost of living when you get there, combined with the lovely fresh food more then compensates.\n",

We are not new to the Betalbatim area but new to this hotel and it lived up to our expectations, breakfast is buffet style and probably amongst the best we have experienced,but if you do not like salt in your omelette or fried eggs you must tell the chef otherwise they put a lot of salt in and it is inedible, we cannot comment on other meals because we booked bed and breakfast only, but were told by other guests that the evening meals were overpriced, we just used our usual local eating places, Albert's, ( great staff, Cherry,Suchant and Sarjeen) Dunstons in the village & Greenlands on Majorda Beach(English owners Roger & Clare who were very helpful with advice etc,) to name a few.Anyone new to the area would enjoy this hotel as a first taste of Betalbatim. We experienced only two downsides, firstly we had to depart our room on the last day at 10am although our flight was not leaving until 1.30am the following day but they did let us use the swimming pool shower!! ( sic) ( we have stayed at the Alagoa before and they always managed to accomodate us,in fact Nitin the manager from the Alagoa came round to see us and say farewell on our last evening and was very surprised that another room could not be found for our use and kindly offered us a room at The Alagoa foc, but by then it was too late, Which goes to prove that the Alagoa, as a small establishment, know how to treat their guests properly) secondly we were not allowed guests in our room even for only a short visit,Carole's sister and brother in law came down to see us from Calangute and we had to entertain them in the hotel reception area. During our beach days we stayed at Seawaves beach shack, Hi to John ,Netty and Simon, they will make you very welcome with always a friendly smile.If you are looking for a great taxi driver and guide look up Bonny Fenandes, who used to be the driver at Alagoa, next season he will have his own Taxi and will be looking for business, a really personable and friendly knowledgeable young guy. Betalbatim area is a lot quieter than North Goa and seems to be predominantly frequented by middle aged Brits who do not like hassle,hustle and bustle.Quick hello to Jose and Alan to let you know we have found a wonderful apartment to rent next year for 5 months, hope to see you at Seawaves next Year\n",

Tucked away in a quiet country lane, ten minutes walk to the beautiful uncrowded beach with enough beach shacks to eat and drink at without being overrun with them. Seawaves Beach Shack is excellent with great food and service.Just down the road from the Villiago Hotel is a small restaurant called Alberts. We found the food to be very good with a great choice although due to its commanding position being the only restaurant very close to the hotel slightly more expensive but in actual fact nowhere seemed too pricey in Goa especially compared to UK prices. The Hotel has good rooms, we had a very large room with a balcony overlooking the gardens but some people had smaller rooms, they all seem to vary. We had a meal in the hotel on our first night but when we wanted a quiet drink at the bar at 10.30 p.m. we were told it was closed. Irene the Manager is making sweeping changes to the structure of this hotel and therunning of it, in her words \"the staff need a lot more training\" although we found most of them polite and courteous, but the trainee chef in the mornings could not cook the eggs properly or seem to understand that english people que and some but not all Russians shout their instructions at the chef and do not bother to que and then wonder why people get annoyed. There are no chairs for the large balconies but this is being addressed and Irene said new chairs will be delivered in February. We put our lounge chairs on the balcony but some rooms only have settees so it is not possible to do this. All in all a good hotel and Irene cannot do enough to make your stay as pleasant as possible and as I say the restaurant staff are changing the way things are going to be run and the bar was being repainted when we left on Thursday evening 8th December.You can take a twenty minute walk or slightly longer to the main centre of the villiage where you will find the Pentagon restaurant which by all accounts is very good but we did not go in that direction but we know people that did and gave good feedback. Also Martins Corner is in that direction - if you don't feel like walking you can take a taxi from the hotel for 200 rupees. (80 rupees roughly to the pound).You can walk to Majorda which is a right turn when you reach the beach or take a left to Colva about 35minutes either way walking along the beach. Colva is busy and so too is the beach but you can find a quiet spot if you want to as the beach is vast.I hope this is useful and have a great holiday.\n",

Restaurant served up good buffets with candle lit tables by the pool side. They usually have some live band or singer or DJ on alternate evenings adding to the pleasure. The buffet spread was decent on all days, though we felt the menu lacked variation and proper blending at times - scope for improvement there so far as menu planning is concerned.A-la-carte orders in particular were very well prepared and the restaurant staff needs particular mention for their detailed attention to guest needs.The location of the hotel is a bit of a walk upto the beach, but its not that bad.Electricity cuts are frequent but the power generator backup was usually quite prompt and we did not feel inconvened at any point.All in all, a great place to stay if one is looking for a mid-priced well maintained hotel with good basic amenities and just a small walk from the sunset beach.\n",

It is an expensive hotel if you do not have a membership. But with a membership you just have to pay the utility charges. It is a brand new property. It is just 800 mts from the beach. The rooms are awesome and the bed are very very good. They have a swimming pool, and a restaurant where the food is very good. You must try the Chicken Tikka Masala. The staff is friendly but a bit inexperienced. The service was a bit slow. But over all it was a very nice trip. I would definitely recommend the hotel.\n",

We hired a bike and went to sightseeing in North Goa in the morning, while returning in the evening, we simply lost to find the way to hotel, as it is located deep inside a village (betalbatim). Though we were using google maps, because of bad signal, it couldn't help us to find the right direction and even direction boards (with hotel name) were not at all available (you'll find many boards of different hotels at every junction).Hospitality is poor. Service is also poor. Because of non-season, not many guests were there in the hotel and still, we have to wait good 40 mins to get our food after ordering it. Food is also very average, particularly south indians won't enjoy it. In the hotel prospectus, they've mentioned that internet connection is provided in every room, which actually they didn't and when I asked to use net connection for 10 mins at their lobby, they said it will cost 200/- and it is damn slow...\n",

The best rooms would be the first floor rooms which have their balcony overlooking the lotus/lily pond. The overall atmosphere is really calm and peaceful. Good for a quick getaway. We were travelling from Hyderabad and chose to travel by train, getting down at Palakollu station. You can get autos from here to the resort(250 rs). There is nothing else close by, no restaurants, nothing. The food at the resort is overpriced. APTDC resort is just adjacent to the sterling resort. We used to have food from there. Also the cab to get you to the station from resort will charge you around 1000 rs, so we got the number of the auto who dropped us to the resort and called him when we had to leave. Cheaper option :)Wifi there in restaurant area, really really slow.The small hut like structure, close to the swimming pool, with a view of the Godavari, best place to hang out. Only negative we felt were the front desk guys. Seemed too bored to care. No smile, too much time to get things done, when we were checking out, asked them to send someone to pick up luggage, took forever, we took our luggage ourselves.

At the onset I was skeptical however I took my chances after looking at the pictures and I am glad to state that they did not disappoint me. Infact, it was the first time that I saw a resort which was exactly the way it looked in the pictures online.Since it was only 500 kms from Hyderabad, we chose to drive down. I stayed there for 3 nights and had some of the best authentic Andhra food which was specially selected for us by the Restaurant Manager Mr.Rajesh. He also went a step ahead and got some dishes prepared for us which were not part of the standard menu.The resort was spick and span and had spacious rooms with excellent house keeping facilities. The balcony of our room opened towards the Lotus Pond. Resort Manager Mr.Tulsiram was a perfect host. When he got to know about the occasion that we were celebrating, he was kind enough to decorate our room with flowers, towels and balloons, he also sent us a cake which was very kind of him.We did a local village tour early in the morning and that was a great experience as well, We had fresh coconut water, the coconuts were plucked from the tree in front of us.All in all I would definitely recommend this place for a good break from the hectic city life.Once again thank you to the resort team for making our stay special and memorable.Cheers!Bharat\n",

Approach roads are okay but donot take the left turn immediately after the Godavari bridge, instead go further down by about 500 meters or so and take the cone left turn.We reached here in the evening and were like where did we land up. Moved in, easy checkins. We had taken 4 rooms right at the spiral stairs. This place is just simply awesome. The rooms are clean. Has a nice living, kitchen area, dining table/chairs, a bedroom with a lovely balcony (view is simply awesome). You can see Godavari river from here and the greens.Now let me tell you one thing. Lilly. The entire resort is beautifully built around a pond of lillys. Different types of them. They even have Amazonas lilly. We found a few of them clicking which could even hold a new born baby. Its a teeat for the eyes, be it when you wake up, walk to the restaurant, get in get out, or just simply sit there and keep watching. We stayed here for 3 nights. I wish to come here for atleast a week. My mom, daughter and my wife all loved this place. Now about the resort management. They are simply too good. I firgot the restaurant manager's name. But he took care very small little thing you can think of. Food be it ala carte or the buffet were tasty. They even went out of way to get us something that was not in the buffet. You dont find restaurants like that too often.

Serene atmosphere to calm our mind. Clean air for the lungs.Beautiful ponds with lilies, lotuses and coconut trees,beautifully illuminated - a feast for the eyes. Coconut grove in a vast area - to walk around. A clean and well maintained swimming pool - to soak up. A well designed vishranti mantap with swings and benches close to the majestic Godavari river-to laze away. A few indoor and outdoor games - to keep active. A good restaurant. Add to these helpful and friendly staff. The resort is picture perfect - ideal place for people who want to relax.The restaurant menu should include Andhra specials. Cost could be reduced. There is no library. Hence carry your own books that you wanted to read but couldn't find time.

The rooms, the linen and bathrooms are clean and comfortable. The property is well maintained and has a pond which gives the resort a great look. The food is average as some of the dishes are good while the others are pretty average. There are limited options. The complimentary breakfast was good. Below are a few pointers:1. Food: Opt for handi biriyani, dum aloo. Rotis are not great thus we had to eat kulchas (they are good but made of maida so not a preferred choice). Pasta is on menu but was not available except for spaghheti.2. Property and amenities: Good. It has a decent pool, volleyball space, table tennis, game room which is great (It has carroms, taboo etc.) and activities room which can be used to dance on self selected music. It has cycles also available which need to be rented to ride on them.3. Connectivity: Wifi is only available in lobby. It should be made available in rooms too.

A very quite place in the middle of a man made pond full of lotus flowers of different colors very close to Godavari river. Rooms were very neat, spacious and comfortable. Great staff and their hospitality was superb. The resort Manager Mr. Prithviraj is a very nice person who tries to make your stay extremely comfortable. The restaurant manager Mr. Rajesh was outstanding and personally took care of the requirements of the guests. Food items in the menu card appear limited but if you want something specific Mr. Rajesh tries his best to get you the same. Rest of the staff were also very polite and helpful. We traveled by train from Chennai to Rajahmundry from where it takes around 2 hours to reach the location. We hired a car for 4 days from RV Tours, Rajahmundry for local sightseeing since this is much cheaper. The driver from RV Tours was again very helpful and took us to all important temples. There are not many attractions near the resort other than many temples including the famous Narasimha Swamy temple at Antarvedi and Someswara Swamy temple in Bhimavaram. Any visit must be planned between October to early March since the weather can really get very hot during summer when it may be difficult to venture out. This is a sort of a remote location and it is better to carry essential medicines with you when you visit their resort. During the past few years Sterling has improved its facilities in all its locations and Dindi despite being functional only for past 9 months is another feather in the cap of Sterling.

The food is deliciously authentic Andhra cuisine, along with a range of Indian/continental options, although we feasted exclusively on the local delicacies. The staff at the restaurant took great care of us. The resort manager Mr Thulsiram was relentlessly thoughtful and paid attention to every detail to ensure impeccable quality and service. The manager of housekeeping did a stellar job to keep the room clean and well stocked with the basics of water, fruits and bath supplies. The welcome drink of buttermilk was fantastic, as were the daily supply of Rasthikeli bananas and oranges. We were a family of 3 couples and 3 children and traveled from Chennai for the first time to Dindi. We arrived a couple of days before Christmas and stayed for 4 days and the team made my daughter's 6th birthday a very special occasion! My children have now become big fans of the Bottabomulus, which are giant dolls from the region and were a feature of the christmas eve celebrations. Look forward to many more vacations at this resort in the care of Mr Thulsiram and with Sterling\n",

			"review" : "\nI wen on Vacation with my family to Dindi - By the Godavari resort (from 29-12-15 to 02-01-16) for 4 nights. I would say my overall experience was pathetic to say the least. Here are few of my observations/feedback:I spoke to some of the other guests who were non-members and came to know that they were staying in privileged rooms (which were supposed to be given to members), but where as I was put into a guest room saying no studio rooms were available. I really don't know how can you make your member stay in a guest room and make the non-members stay in a privileged studio rooms.The buffet menu provided was very ordinary and routine with absolutely no variety, it was very boring to eat the same kind of stuff for 4 days. Restaurant staff was never helpful and they absolutely have no training on how to interact with guests, especially this guy Mithun should be told and seriously trained on how to be polite and interact with guests. Mr Rajesh who is the restaurant in charge should be told by someone to treat all his guests equally and that there shouldn't be any partiality towards certain guests. I find him to be ridiculous!We have no option in Dindi resort to book a private cab, so we have to go with what ever is provided to us by Sterling resorts. You guys charge 15 Rs per KM plus taxes which is a very high rate. I don't think anyone in the country charges this kind of price per KM. When I checked with the cab driver they too agreed that 15 Rs per KM was very high. Private cab guy charged us 350 Rs for a drop from Palakollu railway station to Sterling resorts which is 15 KMs, but sterling is charging us 950 Rs for the same drop :)New year eve celebration was again a open loot from the members where we ended up paying 4500 for 3 of us which included my 7 years old daughter. This price can get you into some of the best new year eve celebrations in Hyderabad. First of all why should we pay for new year eve celebrations is it not the resorts responsibility to take care of that or at least for the members? Funny thing is we ended up paying this huge amount but still we couldn't get bottle of drinking water as even that is an extra chargeWe weren't provided with any complimentary soaps, shampoo, shaving kit, tooth paste or tooth brush during our stay. None of the staff members were pleasing to talk with and none of them were trained to be pleasing. We have to literally chase the restaurant staff to take our order and sometimes I felt it would be better to have your food sitting in your room than that restaurant. I tried to reach the resort manager to give my feedback on all these, but Mr Manager was never reachable. To be frank I don't even know the name of the resort manager and doesn't even know how he looks like. I would not recommend any of my friends for Dindi sterling resort and I would never ever visit that place even if I'm given a all inclusive free stay.\n",

The surroundings of this resort are Serene and Picturesque and would match that of the Kerala backwater resorts. The Highlight of this Resort is the nice layout of the rooms around the Lotus pond where we could see Lotus in various colors and size bloom. The Pictures shown in the website is what you see there. The rooms are comfortable and large enough to accommodate a family of four. We took a studio room with balcony opening to the Lotus Pond.This resort is newly built and there are few things that are still in making but the overall experience has been very good.The housekeeping staff is good and very prompt.The Restaurant décor is just fine and they could have made it little bit more snazzy when I compare it with other Sterling properties.The food is really good and I enquired if we could get a local cuisine for dinner and I was thrilled to relish among the best South Indian fare by a local Chef. The bar has not started yet and might start once they get the license.The location of the swimming pool is just adjacent to the River Godavari and the Evening looks scintillating with the sunset shining over the river.The landscape around pool is mostly completed and addition of few kids outdoor rides (swing, slides etc) and hammock will be awesome.Special thanks to Mr Tulsiram who is the Resort Manager for personally taking feedbacks from every guests to make sure that everyone is having the best of experiences during their stay at Resort.One could also take Boat rides and other water sport activities from the APTDC resort just adjacent to the sterling resorts.\n",

But its kind of expected if you factor in fact that is pioneer of 'time sharing' hotel concept in india - and that means customer has already paid upfront for hundreds of nights. Anyway I wasn't a member but their attitude carries over to 'walk-in' customers as well. We arrived 9am and by the time we had breakfast it was just 2 hours until checkin. They charged Rs1500 for just 2 hours. Our infant was acting up due to tiring journey so we had to grudgingly accept. The hotel was so unoccupied at that time that they even canceled breakfast buffet. I avoided this unreasonably high charge on checkout by booking another night at discounted trip via online discount code I had, and checked out after 5 hours of use. One trick they try to play is to tell the actual charges or availability at last hour. They'll never tell you both. That happened both at checkin as well as checkout and again when asked them to arrange for a cab for drop to station. I had to keep insisting as they were refusing to confirm availability of car till 1 hour before journey. Finally I made alternative arrangements using aptdc resort that is next door. Same goes for their tours to Antarvedi. I would recommend to contact aptdc next door. Resort is quite small. After pond there is little landscape. Godavri flows adjacent but there is no effort made to allow guests to enjoy is beauty. Not even few benches, close to view. You are expected to just walk over to the resort fence look over it. But rooms are spacious and comfortable. Food is average and terribly expensive - for a couple and infant it came to 3000+ for 4 meals, over a day and a half. Nothing fancy ordered. \n",

			"review" : "\nThis property is a new addition to Sterling group. It is located on the banks of the river Godavari in a village named Dindi - which almost 3 hours drive from Vijayawada/ two hours from Rajahmundry. The entire stretch stretch is scenic, with lots of greenery. The resort is located next to AP tourism property. Its a beautiful place built over a Lily pond. All Rooms open to the lily pond, either from the main door or from the balcony.Rooms are very spacious, and well maintained. There are frequent power cuts in the locality, due to the remote location. However the staff do a good job in maintaining the generators and limit the power cut duration to a greater extent.The backyard of the property is maintained well. There are a lot of coconut tress. There are earmarked places for some outdoor activities. The swimming pool is situated at the corner of the property facing the river. The entire landscape as well as the swimming pool is maintained really well. the quality of water in the pool is appreciable.Front desk were very cordial during the reception. Though we had reached very early than the check in time, we were accomodated immediately. Thanks to Teja.Coming to the food, there are very less options to eat out, so we pretty much had all our three meal during our four night stay in the resort. The quality of food was outstanding. Though they had a limited menu, due to the nonavailability of certain ingredients in that region, they made sure the taste and quality is perfect. Special credit to Rajesh - F&B Manager, who made sure that we were taken care with the right type of food. His cool approach and ability to suggest various food varieties is commendable.The room service was timely. Special thanks to Ravi, Mohibul, to name a few.The resort doesn't have a license to operate a bar. However, liquor could be purchased from AP Tourism resort or at few shops in the village.The areas of improvement suggested would be the expertise on the local region and the wifi connectivity, (if something could be done about it). Many of the staff are new, though they took efforts to give us suggestions on the place to visit etc...yet google maps was able to provide us with more info in many instances. i guess this is just a teething issue, which they would over come in the coming months.Over all we had a great time at Dindi, and would surely add this to our yearly tour map. Place worth visiting.Note: Vodafone doesn't at most of the places in the resort.\n",

			"review" : "\nIf you're looking for a quick dash close to Hyderabad, then Dindi By The Godavari is just right. It is overnight by train from Hyderabad (take train to Palakollu station which is 15 kms from the Resort), and return through the same mode.Dindi By The Godavari is a new property by Sterling Group and is on the banks of the river Godavari (as the name suggests), with rooms set around a lily pond, and the swimming pool near the banks. It has the pre-requisite abundant coconut trees in and around the property giving the perfect tropical feel.The rooms, dining arrangements are all standard and good, no reason to complain. The food is nice and the best part is their staff. All are very hospitable and warm, genuinely interested to know your requirements and to do their best to fulfill them.If you're looking for a quiet time, do try to visit on a week day as apparently they are full on weekends! We were a group of 14 adults who had the perfect time on Friday, but Saturday saw another group of 105 come in! The resort is perfect to go with friends, family and has a swimming pool, a games room (with lots of games to play), outdoor games (but it is black cotton soil area so if it rains, don't expect to be playing outdoors), etc.We had a wonderful two days at the resort, and recommend it to everyone!\n",

Since the deal was good so we thought to opt the same. By the time we reached Manali we have called the service desk to ask whether they provide cab for the hotel which they clearly denied. We took a private cab from bus stand to the hotel which is placed around 5 km from it. After reaching the hotel we requested to see the room but they asked us to wait for 30 mins since the room was not cleaned. By the time we wish to see the hotel, we came to know that the hotel was quite different as shown in the pictures. Certain cons which I would like to highlight:\r\n\r\n1. The hotel as mentioned on site is not on Mall Road but far away from it, around 5 km.\r\n\r\n2. Transportation costs around Rs. 200 per side if you wish to go to Mall Road or nearby.\r\n\r\n3. Hotel mentions 80 rooms but have only 33 rooms instead.\r\n\r\n4. There is no facility of Wi-fi as mentioned on websites.\r\n\r\n5. The staff was not at all helpful in sorting out your queries.\r\n\r\n6. No generator facility at the night in case of breakdown.\r\n\r\n7. It seems to be more than a 3 star hotel rather than a resort.\r\n\r\n8. No good restaurants nearby. Only option is to have it in hotel only.\r\n\r\n9. They don't even provide a knife to cut fruits or rather you can say they don't even show courtesy even to facilitate you.\r\n\r\n10. Room cleaning can be done only once and that too as per not your convenience but the time they felt like.\r\n\r\nOverall, a disappointing hotel with a scarcity of many facilities.",

Restaurant facility was available there and I think it was good. Quality and taste wise, the food was nice. Swimming pool was not available in the hotel but some indoor games were available there like chess, table tennis, etc. I visited there by own vehicle with my family for relaxation.

The drivers were finding it hard to drive on these snows covered roads and because of that we reached our hotel after much delay. We booked a room in Sterling Holidays White Mist and due to the snowfall the name was sounding apt. It was snow all over and a very new very different silence. About the hotel i would say, its spacious they have a nice lawn and the thing i liked the most is their indoor activity room. There was something for everybody. Indoor games for children, billiards table for adult and in the night time they arranged a disc party over there. In all it was good. The rooms were not very grand but they were ok. Furniture looked a bit old. But overall it was ok. The good part was they had a microwave in the room and the bad part was hot water was only supplied for few early hours of the day, which i think the hotel management should  think over . Hot water is a must especially in that cold weather. It’s so hard even washing hands with cold water. The staffs were good and i would give five stars to the location of the resort that is just opposite a wine shop which was well stacked. They had all from the very much required rum to party lover’s tequila. So no worries to carry your booze with you . Its imp to mention they even had captan morgan also in their rum section. The food was also good .if you are looking for a relaxed holiday then book this place as it is a little far from the market. I think it was one of the best hotel in that place. So i would suggest either Sterling Holidays White Mist.  All in all it was a nice holiday.     ",

Although it doesnt boast of any large front view of greenery (unlike its neighbour star hotel), once inside, the services are great which is  typical of any Sterling group  we have visited earlier... What we liked is the view from the bedroom which opens to the nearest snow capped mountain, we could see snow building up with rains and towards evening, most of the mountain gets covered and with day light, the snow starts melting out....natures beauty was here to be enjoyed and experienced right from the resort room....The food was hygienic and tasty, their chilli-cheese bread toast became a favourite dish for my daughter ever since.

			"review" : "Sterling Manali is one of the better maintained resorts of Sterling. The Resort is on the other side of River Beas in an area popularly known as New Manali. This gives the visitor an ample peace of mind after a long journey to Manali as compared to hotels/resorts situated on or about the Mall Road. The resort is beautiful and the service and facilities satisfactory. A functioning library, play area and working Activity Department which arranges bon-fires, housies, fun-fairs, etc. everyday comes as a pleasant surprise. The food is OK. The travel desk does not arrange for regular sightseeing tours [as is done in certain other Sterling Resorts] however customized bookings can be done. Always press for a room to be given in the old block rather than being pushed into the new block. Overall, it is a satisfying experience",

The room, located on the 3rd floor was very difficult to access, for elders, as there was no lift !  Putting this behind us, i quickly decided to draw the curtains open to look for the mountains, having read so much about them right here at India Resort Survey and ...well...with a strained neck i managed to spot the snow-caps in all their glory! Fabulous site ! But if one were to look down from the 3rd floor, the site was pathetic, to say the least. (More about that in \\'My Worst Experience\\' below!) Sadly the property dint have much open area to hand out in, but a small neatly landscaped lawn. Breakfast was a disaster (i strongly suggest  that one avoids their buffet breakfast!), while the food served at dinner was quite ok.\r\nRecreational activities ? Another disaster ! Best is to just enjoy the mountains. The weather during the 2nd week of May, was quite warm during the days and at nights just a full-sleeved shirt was quite comfy. Restaurants to visit : \\'Cafe River Music\\', near Club House and \\'Brook Song Flower Garden\\', on the Naggar Road, past Sterling! Ambience at these 2 places was absolutely fantastic!",

No hustle and bustle just realizing the true life. Me, my better half Kiran, my daughter Deepika and my son Mehul, all of them enjoyed a lots of games dancing/disco and food.

We travelled in a group of 5 couples and had planned 3 days in North Goa & 2 days in South Goa.\nWe had placed all of our bookings in South Goa at Villagio - A Sterling resort about 50 days in advance. The complete payment was made in advance by us. On the day we were supposed move from North Goa TO South Goa & check-in @ Villagio hotel, we received a call late in the evening from Villagio hotel manager - \"Manish\"(when our check-in time has already passed by 5 hours !!  Who informed us that a complete block of the hotel is under maintenance as a result of which they wouldn't be able to provide us the rooms.\nWe decided to go to Villagio Hotel to speak to the manager & sort out the matter. TO OUR SURPRISE (& SHOCK) WE FOUND OUT THAT THE BLOCK UNDER MAINTENANCE HAD BEEN ALLOCATED TO DEFENCE EXPO RESERVATIONS THAT WAS HAPPENING DURING THAT WEEK !!!\nThe hotel management was FLATLY LYING on the maintenance reason. On learning this information we challenged Villagio staff to show us the block under maintenance. This request was again denied.\nSo probably what happened is - Villagio Hotel Management gave our (& probably other folks) reserved rooms to some foreign customers who were willing to PAY MORE as a part of the block deal.\nThe most disappointing thing here is the complete UNPROFESSIONAL & UNETHICAL hotel management that gave importance to earn MONEY rather than CUSTOMER LOYALTY.\nVillagio hotel offered us ONLY 2 properties in NORTH Goa. We again & again tried to explain to Villagio Hotel manager - \"Manish\" that all of 2 days activities were planned in South Goa. So North Goa was NOT a viable option for us. But he failed to understand this fact repeatedly.\nOnly available option in South Goa was some 5 star properties that Villagio was NOT willing to compensate. Ultimately we had to search on our own and settle down for a hotel in Panjim. Again we had to do at least 30 - 40 follow-ups for getting the payment for this NEW hotel reimbursed with Villagio hotel management.\nOverall, our experience with Villagio in South Goa has been HORRIBLE.\nNOT only our entire trip plan was disrupted, the HOTEL management did NOT even have the courtesy to talk to us politely and follow up with us to check on the arrangement in the alternate hotel that we had booked.\nVERY UNEXPECTED & SAD for a big chain like Sterling Holidays.\n.

The room was very clean and maintained. The restaurant service was very good and efficient. The restaurant staff was very hardworking and courteous. They can improve upon the buffet spread though ...\nBut we had a big problem with the TV in our room. The TV simply did not work and was not catching signal.

This was the worst experience a customer can expect from self proclaimed 4 star hotel.\r\n\r\nI also got to know that this hotel has a reputation of dishonouring its pre-bookings. So please do think twice before booking this hotel for your next trip.",

I paid 600 INR to just 12 Km. Very much loot. Come to the stay. It was okay type as bathroom had a leakage problem through shower point which was resolved after so many follow up. Now come to food in buffet. I stayed there for 3 nights and menu was same for all these days. I was shocked to see this and it was very limited. Service inside the dining hall was very poor as if you ask for a glass of water you will get once you finish your meal very bad. Morning breakfast was worst.

			"review" : "The Good: The only good part of the Resort has been the ever eager staff of the Food and Beverages Team to help but they were handicapped for want of quality food. No fault of theirs. Kudos to all the boys. But they are at the wrong place.\r\nThe other good part was Mr. Bins Francis and The Spa.\r\n\r\nThe Bad: Millions of Mosquitoes. Could not sleep throughout our stay of 8 days. The food was similar to that of a Nature Cure Center. Nothing to offer. Number of items were very limited. Scared you away.\r\nThe swimming pool is nearly 6' in depth but there isn't any life guard nor are there any safety devices. This is dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe Ugly: There was a snake in our room when my wife walked into the wash room around 8.30pm of 9th January. We had returned from a sightseeing tour and went into the room. When she opened the wash room door, down comes the snake from above the door. We don't know where it came from or how. The sad part of it was that there wasn't any Manager who could handle the crisis. We were stuck out for nearly a couple of hours. Desperate calls and Messages to Mr.Bhim Singh does not elicit any response. The Manager on Duty, Mr.Mannister, was not on duty. When called, he says that he is unwell and hence has not come to the Resort. After frantic efforts, The Executive Chef, Mr.Jagjeet Singh and The Activities manager arrive. They were very kind in trying to calm us down but then the damage was done.\r\n\r\nThe security and housekeeping staff were debating as to what should be done to the snake instead of taking action. They finally decide to eliminate the intruder. But then came the twist - One of the security guards refused to take action citing his religious beliefs. All this while we are suffering. The Housekeeping staff are scared to check the rooms for any other intruders that may be around. They go into the rooms and come out in less than 2 minutes stating all is well. So much for the Resort.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Mr.Bhim Singh decides to be benevolent and calls. When told of the issue and the utter lack of response, says \" I am not on Duty\". So much for a man who is supposed to be much feted by many. \r\nA good leader is one who should be decisive in times of crisis. This gentleman gains his reputation by being proactive at normal times and being fussy to serve you when there is hardly anything worth serving.\r\n\r\nThe Saving Grace: One gentleman stood out in this crowd - Mr.Chirag. When there was chaos all around with the snake, he was calm and composed and finally handled the issue very well. He brought in a lot of comfort and shifted us to different rooms and put us at ease.\r\n\r\nMy wife has a pacemaker and has a heart condition that could have turned very ugly if something would have happened to her due to the shock. We were fortunate that all is well.\r\nI would not recommend this place to anyone.\r\n\r\nBarring a few bright spots such as Chirag, Jagjeet Singh and the Food & Beverage staff, there is nothing else. But what can they do if the property does not have what it takes to make a great Resort.\r\nI would have loved to Title this review as \"OH MY GOD THERE IS A SNAKE IN MY ROOM\" but felt it to be too melodramatic. Nevertheless, it is almost true. What with the harrowing time we had.",

Either staff is not paid properly or there is no discipline. However, the issue was resolved.

Vehicles are allowed to come in the village from other parts of Goa however while going out from the village, one needs to hire villagers vehicle that too with hefty cost. From the resort to Colva which is 2. 7 kms, we were charged Rs. 400 for only drop. For the people who wants to have dinner at Colva or wants to have party at city, they need spend extra from pocket.\r\n\r\nFurther, self driven vehicles are not available at there. One needs to hire at Madgaon with private number.\r\n\r\nGoa is famous for beaches, however Sea shore is 10 min walking distance from the resort through isolated road which is again not comfortable.

Swashwati (Manager) is very co-operative lady. But the food is average, room service is poor. Bike, car, taxi outside hotel is costly as the hotel people have commission in it and you don't have any option in the area. We hired a car from market, took info from Justdial.\r\n\r\nNearby Beaches are Colva beach and Betalbatim Beach. Colva is a good beach with shacks, water sports, good crowd and action.

My advice is if anyone can hire taxi on rent ( remember it must be black board with yellow no) would be great.\r\nIf any one planning Scuba diving it is at coco beach or Candolim Beach but arrangements have to be made in advance as near 4 hours go in training on day-1 and approx. 06 -07 hours is required on day 2.\r\nDolphin ride is waste of time. If you want to spend quality time with your soul mate don't forget to go at Palolem Paradise beach in south Goa. Only thing it is furthest (approx. 45 km. )",

Service was very good and the pool was clean. One negative thing is food is too expensive, for one time you have to spend nearly 5000/- for a family of 4 which is exorbitant.

There is not much variety in food and its costly too.  The service also is very slow.  Personally I did not like the taste too.

The hotel as mentioned on sited is not on mall road but far away from it around 5kms.2.Transportation costs around 200rs per side if you wish to mall road or nearby.3,Hotel mentions 80 rooms but have only 33rooms instead.4.There is no facility of Wi-fi as mentioned on websites.5.The staff was not at all helpful in sorting out your queries.6.No generator facility at the night in case of breakdown.7.It seems to be more than a 3star hotel rather than a resort.8.No good restaurants nearby.only option is to have it in hotel only.9.They don't even provide a knife to cut fruits or rather you can say they don't even pay courtesy even to facilitate you. 10.Room cleaning can be done only once and that too as per not your convenience but the time they felt like.Overall a disappointing hotel with a scarcity of many facilities.\n",

Half the resort was being renovated.

Cons : The hotel is in the Prini area which is far away from the main manali area.  No local transportation to the main manali area available.  So u vl actually need ur own car or the hotel car for transportation.  There was no activity area and no wifi in the hotel. Reason for the same was  that the hotel was just renovated.  Also during our stay, the lift was not working for two full days. When we and some other customers complained, they said that engineers are working over it and that the same will be in working condition in and hour. Bt till we left the hotel, the same was not working. We had to climb up and down 3 floors everytime. There were also elderly aged people in the hotel who also had to face this lift issues. Bt the reception did not bother to get the lift repaired. Hot water is not available 24*7. Service is not that quick and prompt. U vl have to call atleast twice to get things done.\n",

The other interesting thing is that in this particular resort you had to ask for everything as no information is shared including tours that the Resort can apparently arrange on our behalf.The only consolation is that the renovation is being correctly done as the rooms were really great with a wonderful view and there was no construction noise. The food served in the Restaurant was good and there are large TVs strategically placed where we could see the India - South Africa match over dinner.On the whole, I would say that the family had a relaxing trip however we would have loved to see a true 4 Star experience where the Resort staff would go out of their way to make the experience a truly memorable one.\n",

The half part of the hotel buildings is under construction and renovation that makes feel bit bothered but I must say the service/employees go out of their way to make sure your stay is as pleasant as it can be. The rooms are enormous and clean, with all of the necessary conveniences. Mountain range from back side windows when there is snow fall look pretty beautiful. Hotel is established in slightly lesser area but the location is superb. Amazing Manali was seen from here. Full of snow n white was never so beautiful. The breakfast buffet is a great way to start the day. The service there was better than many restaurants and the food was just outstanding. Little extras like the nightly turndown service, take out menus the one night we wanted to order, bottled water, and the overall friendliness of the staff makes you feel very special. They will go out of their way to make sure your stay is beyond perfect. You will not be disappointed. Trust me, I would like to give special recognition to the Hotel Manager Hemant Das who was simply wonderful toward us. He was most helpful in answering or numerous questions and always offered a kind smile. We felt very homely being called by our names every time we walked in and out and at the restaurant was the perfect touch, and the manager will make sure you are taken care of.

You would need to hire a taxi every time at an inflated price to go to the city. If you hire any taxi to go places like Solang Valley, Manikaran, they would charge you higher as they have to pick you up from a far off place. You cannot take a walk in the evening outside as it is an isolated place and not safe at all. Food too is okay. I like hill station food and eating at different places, but you have no option for dinner than to eat at the hotel itself.

Very basic room like a government rest house. No activity and least options in kids play area (a small room) with only ludo, chess and carrom as options. Air hockey table and video game on payable basis but these too were out of order. Couple of cycles were available for kids but for that charges were 150 Rs for 1 hour. Being an old property they hardly have any space and are misfit to be called as a resort.We requested front office incharge many times to lodge our protest and for feedback; surprisingly the resort manager or GM never came in front to counsel or take ownership of lapses.In bone chilling winter; hot water is available only from 7-10AM in morning and 7-9 PM in evening; during other times they will deliver a bucket; Our room had a heat convector but it was just a simple fan blower ;We were told that the electricity load in the day is low hence it wont work well but after 10 PM in night it will work well. Naggar area of Manali where this resort is located has much better options; hence it is advised that do explore those too.Sterling Ooty-Fern Hill is far better and a true resort but at Manali it seems the management has least interest to operate; the morale of staff and team looked very down and they were all helpless whenever we reported issues.\n",

Standing up to Sterling hospitality this resort leaves no stone unturned to make to make your stay a memorable one. Even though, this time around, the main building was undergoing renovations, you would never realize that until you walked to the parking which presently doubled up as a debris collection ground, but without compromising on the parking.facility. The staff is friendly and courteous, the check in quite swift. The rooms are good, I visited this resort after 13 years this time and should admit that the decor has kept up with the times. The sheets and towels are impeccably spotless, the toilets clean and smelling good. The restaurant, presently a make-shift arrangement due to the renovations was decent and the choice of food is varied, right from South Indian to Continental to Local, its all available. The holiday activities room is equipped with games (though I think they were lesser as compared to my last visit) With all the positives in it favour, Sterling Resorts have changed their full-fledged kitchens in to dry kitchens in the rooms (a few plates, cutlery, bowls, a microwave oven, a coffee heating pot, etc.). The very reason one prefers Sterling was the facility of having a fully-equipped kitchen so you could have home food even in a distant land (you just cant eat out every day). This is the probable cause for my kids to getting a stomach infection and still we didn't have a choice (though not because of their restaurant, but again you cant keep eating in their restaurant too), with fever temperature reaching 103 we called the front desk if any medical help could be obtained, the support offered was inadequate (a doctor on call would charge Rs. 1500) and the nearest hospital was a Mission hospital at Mall Road.Luckily the medications we were carrying helped and the kids were fine the next day. Overall the experience was a nice one, but hey this could've been expected from any good hotel, WHY CHOOSE STERLING THEN?\n",

There are shops in the vicinity for basic needs and the property is adjacent to Holiday inn.Cons: Room - Post check-in there were hairs on the bed, upon complaint sheets was changed. I was given room towards the road side so sleep quality wasn't good enough. The washroom needs renovation since its a decade old style. Handwash and shower gel was provided. Insufficient charging facility was available in room. The cable network was not working well so all those who wish to watch television for a while might be disappointed. Hot water facility was unavailable during day, however, they were willing to give water in the bucket from outside.Food: Buffet could have been better, all those who like parathas might be disappointed with raw ones. Options of buffet could have been more. Table cloth was dirty in the restaurant. Breakfast starts 7.30 am but in our case it wasn't completely ready upto 8 am. Food menu overpriced as compared to other better hotels in the town. The staff in the restaurant could have been more courteous, soft spoken, willing to serve food even at the time of breakfast. If you order ice cubes in the room then its chargeable. Lift/ Elevator: Wasn't working at the time of cheek-in however from evening started working.Location: Its approx 5 kms from the mall road, one has to wait for sometime at the road for passing by auto rickshaws and taxis fare of which is expensive during season 100 to 400 depends upon your bargain. Travel Desk: The concerned person was not available at the travel desk so a lady (sitting at travel desk) guided us, however, she didn't guide us properly despite apparently knowing everything since we told that we won't be staying for long in the hotel. Exaggerated claim to be a part of esteemed sterling holidays. Very disappointed. I hope management listens !!\n",

I would insist that you request the hotel for a Mountain view room from where the sunrise view is quite spectacular. The food of the restaurant's hotel is quite good especially the Mughlai food. Service of the hotel was also good as expected by Sterling resorts. For looking around in Manali, the travel desk at the basement will help for the travel plans and vehicle arrangements. We managed to stay in October , 2013 and that was a good time to see Manali as after some time Rohtang Paas was shut down due to bad weather conditions up there, also being a off time for manali , you will find the place less crowded.In all a great hotel with a very affordable price tag.\n",

I had visited this place with my family includes my 3 yr old daughter. This hotel look good from exterior but interiors are pathetic. Floor was broken, tiles was broken, no light in hall except one small bulb. (can you imagine I spend one night). Poor heating facility (I had given brandy to my family). Room's were stinking. Geyser was pathetic. Bathroom look like Hospital. And I had paid astronomical high price to book this hotel when it was available at as low as 1700 rs. per day.

RCI connected to hotel. Mean time I had booked another hotel and left the hotel. That time Hotel Manager Mr. Rajesh meet me and promise me better room and service. And they actually done really well. In this hotel few room are in better condition. (still avoid it). I had plan for 7 days. out of that 2 days I was Screwed very badly. Next 3 days things was much better.

We were staying at a duplex unit, well furnished, with a lovely balcony, small kitchenette, with microwave and toaster etc. The facilities for the kitchenette were not exactly fantastic but was just adequate for the two of us. The service was superb, every one at the resort was extremely friendly. We also ate a few times at the restaurant - the food was good and very cheap, especially with the usual RCI discounts! We did not use any other facilities. The only two problems were the innumerable steps we had negotiate every time we went out and also the almost inadequate heating facilities. Although there were two room heaters (Bajaj) but they hardly emitted any warm (leave alone hot!) air and were merely like decorations! Fortunately we had carried a VERY GOOD Philips room heater as well as an electric under-blanket - both of which came in extremely handy in the super cold temperatures. We were there in mid-December with temperatures plunging to minus figures at nights. Although the resort told us they only supply hot water during some hours in the mornings and evenings - we always got enough water whenever we opened the taps!!! Which was very useful! I suppose their insulations are good! Over all we had a really nice time there! Hope to get back again sometime.\n",

Our other requirement for a fridge was also accepted by the Manager readily.Restaurant though not very big, staff serves with a smile. An offbeat request is also implemented. We wanted to taste some Himachali preparation and it was specially prepared by the chef. Such small things make you happy. Our hearty thanks for that. Food is hygienically prepared, quality wise good and reasonably priced too. Rooms are large enough.

For us that was ok because we had our own taxi but even then the resort is surrounded by small shops of Naggar road which makes this place little noisy and crowded outside.Resort also provides some indoor activities and help in arranging taxi to Rohtang and other outdoor adventure activities at decent price. Resort staff was also very nice, active and helpful. I found food and breakfast buffet average but again the service was soo good that they have provided additional items in no time whatever we asked. One more suggestion is related to marking of hot water taps in these two rooms - its not very clearly marked on taps and therefore we struggled and wasted some water.Overall, our stay was relaxed and enjoyable and I liked the resort.\n",

			"review" : "\nWe visited the resort in the third week of June, 2013. The resort is located about 3 kms away from the main city in the village of Prini. Many fellow travelers have complained that the location of the property isn't very good but that is no true. If you wish to stay in a resort, you have to stay a bit away from the main town. Even more expensive resorts like the Holiday Inn, Club Mahindra and the Honeymoon Inn are located in close vicinity. Only Manali Resorts is located at a better place while others like the Span are located even further out. The staff is very friendly and courteous. During our 5 day long stay, we were treated really well. The rooms are clean and spacious but seem to be in need of some modern flair. As we stayed in a Studio apartment, we also had a microwave and an electric kettle at our disposal. The food from the in-house restaurant is extremely good. They have a wide variety of items and the taste is fantastic. They hold activities in the evening and the incharge knows how to give people a good time. The game room too is very good as you can play games like Air Hockey, Table Tennis, Carrom, Snakes and Ladders. For the younger amongst us, consoles like Nintendo Wii and PS2 are available for hire.All in all, the experience was pretty good.\n",

The rooms were big and had a wooden flooring.. since Manali is very cold, wooden flooring is always a plus point. The room had a mini kitchen with microwave. Housekeeping staff was good and cleanliness ws maintened in the room on all days.Althought the restarurant food is good.. its a bit expensive... (not too sure.. but around 75 rs for plain roti..)

Food was also pretty good except that South Indian dishes could be improved. They even packed for us breakfast n lunch as early as 4.00 am when we had to leave for Rohtang pass.

The suite is large with a sit-out and has views of snow-clad mountains albeit distant and not that great. But location wise there are better placed hotels in Manali, that provide better views and are closer to the city centre. This one is a bit far-off and the approach road has been severely damaged recently. There's no Wi-Fi but there is an Internet cafe which charges Rs 60 for half an hour of surfing which seems expensive! The food too is very expensive, for instance a humble sada dosa costs Rs 165 before taxes! Overall I found the accommodation and service to be good, but if you really want to enjoy Manali choose a scenic locale or a hotel in close proximity to the mall road depending on what you like. This one unfortunately scores low on both these fronts. Also considering that the suite costs Rs 4000 per night before discounts, it might be a tad expensive, and am not aware of the condition of other rooms! They have other facilities like spa, fitness center etc but I didn't try them, who needs them after all with all there is to see and do in Manali. But I did get a call informing me about these facilities on the first day of my stay and these seemed expensive too!\n",

Food is also quite nice and plenty of varieties. Well is this the positive side. Only one negative part is the quality of facility. Some places the wooden floor is broken, heater was not working and toilet is not clean either. We enjoyed our stay and had a great trip with sterling. I recommend everyone to visit Manali and i believe Manali is a small remote hilly town and this standard is really appreciable. heard they renovating their resorts which is good news for future tourist.For Honeymooner please go for honeymoon suit which gives you awesome snow covered mountain view.

This truly applies to the Sterling White Mist Resort at Manali which I, my hubby & my 14-year old daughter visited during the Deepavali week of November 2012. We reached on 10th night and found the entire resort lit up with fairy lights. What followed was five days of sheer fun & frolic with various activities which the resort offered. Great accommodation, superb views (especially to see the snow-clad peaks from the dining hall window while having your breakfast & lunch), delicious food but the most praiseworthy was the warm, friendly, courteous, cooperative, honest, ever-smiling and ever-helpful staff, pampering us to the hilt and taking care about our minutest requirements. The word \"NO\" does not appear in their dictionary at all, whether it was the security guard at the entrance, the gardener watering the plants, the housekeeping or kitchen staff, the front desk executives or the Resort Manager himself. This speaks volumes about the level of training imparted to the staff. Deepavali was the most exciting day, as right from \"puja\" in the morning to the games & lighting fire crackers in the evening to the buffet spread at night, everything was so magical that we felt we were transported into another land. The resort's travel desk is a great help even if you do not take any packages from them. White Mist had a nice recreation room, a cosy bar and well-maintained garden & lawns. We occupied a clean duplex room, with partial kitchen and the room was fitted with the best of amenities. Although we couldn't take advantage of the spa, I am sure even that could have been a good experience. Thank you for such a memorable stay and a wonderful experience which we are going to cherish for long time to come. As I have aptly titled, it is truly a \"HOME AWAY FROM HOME!\"\n",

The puja in the morning of Deepavali and the get together in the evening made it all the more special for us and made it feel like truly a home away from home. The kitchenette is well equipped and the ambience is serene and pleasant.The thoughtful quote in our room by Jane AustenTO SIT IN THE SHADE ON A FINE DAY AND LOOK UPON THE VERDANT GREEN HILLS IS THE MOST PERFECT REFRESHMENT.stayed with us even after our return back to Delhi.Thank You.

We checked-in at around 5 in the morning and does not had any problem getting the room. The receptionist(poor guy got up in middle of sleep does not know about our arrival) welcomed us and provided the room within no time.(The only disappointment is they charged 1000 bucks for early check-in, can be ignored for their service). The rooms were very spacious, clean and linens were fresh. As soon as we entered the room we jumped on to the bed and had a nice sleep(since we had a terrific journey last night from Shimla). Woke up at 9:30 and were hungry like mad. We had breakfast in the room only. We ordered Parathas, Poori bhaji, toast. The food was exceptionally good. I did not have this kind of food any where else in such type of properties. The taste of the food was awesome. The chef there deserves an EXCELLENT rating. For the rest of our stay we had food in the resort itself.The staff there were very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place for any kind of travellers. Overall the experience was very good and Sterling keep up the good work.\n",

The property is sprawling, very well maintained and the pictures uploaded will give you a fair idea. The dining facilities are wholesome with buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner and are available as an added package. View of the Himalayas from the dining room is to kill for. Service at times was sluggish but with a little nudging got better. Lots of games and activities for children as well as family if you want some leisure and the travel desk is most helpful if you want to venture out. It is situated a bit far from Manali proper in Prini - a small village and the distance could actually work as an advantage, far from the madding crowd. I'll definitely be back with the family..\n",

The road from Kulu to Manali is really bad and was under construction. The stay at Sterling was pretty good. We got a duplex room facing the valley with a bed above the staircase and a double bed below. The resort is pretty well maintained and there is also an option to preserve the bed sheet for an extra day without cleaning in order to save water and contributing to the environment. You just need to put a pamphlet at the bedside onto the bed while leaving for this. The food is also OK and you get a good deal by booking a two meal for your family in the morning. There are indoor games avaiable and the resort is located close to the town centre.There is also a spa where one can get a good massage done in traditional Kerala ayurvedic style. The masseurs are also experienced in the trade.The resort also organises outdoor trips for snow sleds, paragliding and cable car riding besides trips to Kulu for Shawls, trips to Rohtang pass which is the highest motorable road etc. We enjoyed our trip thoroughly but I would suggest a traveller to go there during end of winter rather.\n",

I advice you to take journey thru Volvo nt car ,as the total journey was tedious.Very first thing that amused me in hotel was there was no Valet Parking. Although the hotel looked good from the outside, it did not have a lift, neither were the rooms all that good. The last thing you would want after a tiring journey, is smelling bathrooms. The bathrooms seriously need some furnishing. One thing very good though were the views.Take left side rooms with a view to mountains not valley.And there are some parking facing rooms, avoid them.There was no lift in the hotel, so try keep your booking to 1st floor only. Hot water was available in the morning from 7-10 and in the evening from 4-6 and not 24 hours. The quality of the room is not worth the money you pay. Old wardrobe's and bad bathrooms perhaps attributed to it. Facilities were decent with a small kitchen inside the room, which makes it worth while for families with small children as the same will be useful making milk, tea, home food etc. We happened to visit the spa and it was nice. Very nice clean and well kept. Good playing activities. The resort has good playing activities, somethings children would definitely enjoy.We did Water-Rafting too in Kulu, which is 1 hour drive from the Resort. Dont go for outside activities co-ordinated by hotel staff- They have their margins.There was only 1 restaurant but was quite good. Nice breakfasts and food.It is a decent family resort with facilities suiting them. But if you are a couple, or a bunch of college friends you can perhaps find better places. Surely the resort does not live up to it's brand Sterling's name. It's perhaps one of their not so good one's. Not worth the money for my liking.The only silver lining of the whole package was the cheap rates provided by our tour operator.We booked on internet from Antilog Vacations which r very budget & the best for manali tours.They suggested us that Apple country resort was a better option but we somehow stuck to this hotel.Anyways , we r contented that we got cheaper rates than the fellow travellers\n",

The travel desk also go out of their way to help us for sightseeing and vehicle arrangement.We checked in on 29th December morning and were to leave on 30th evening. As check out was in the evening we were charged for two days (quite rightfully). We went to the bustand and found out that our bus was cancelled due to heavy snowfall. We contacted the hotel and they allowed us to stay that night as we had paid for the same. The next morning due to heavy snowfall we could not leave Manali. We left only at 9:00pm on December 31st. For this extra day we were not charged at all. This was one of the best act by any hotel i have ever seen. They totally understtod our situation and did not charge us at all.\n",

And it is a nice place; however a lot needs to be improved, really. We reached the resort around 9 in the night as it was snowing and driving was a bit difficult. There weren’t many boards giving directions on how to reach the resort. Upon reaching the place we found out there was no valet parking available. The porch was not really big enough to keep the snow away. There were no door mats to keep the dirt and muck away from the reception / lobby area.On checking in we saw both the rooms were done differently. Beds, mattresses, etc. all were different. The rooms were facing the lobby which was facing outside world. Snow and water from above was all dripping in the lobby area. As a result we had dirt marks all across the room. Also during the night snow used to slide from the room and parts of it used to hit our room door wetting whole place. On top of all this the heaters provided in the rooms were not efficient enough. There was no provision of connecting another heater. Hot water was available in the morning from 7-10 and in the evening from 4-6 and not 24 hours.The room service was good. They managed to serve nice hot food in the room even at these temperatures.They had just one restaurant but food was good.We happened to visit the spa and it was amazing. Very nice clean and well kept. The temperature inside was perfect.All in all things can get better.\n",

The view from this hotel is very panoramic and quite view worthy. We had our room with balcony over the play ground. we had direct view of mountains from our balcony. We got snow very next day when we reached at Manali, our room was warm to stay in comfortably. The room we had was spacious enough to accommodate four of us. The room service was quick and on the dot. The Breakfast was excellent which compromised the lunch and diner quality. The service was very polite and social. The hotel staff was very courteous and ready to help at any length also they have all types of arrangements for every need of their customers. We had gone to Manali for first time and we were not having any idea what places we visit? The courtesy shown by the hotel reception and Manager and guided us with all details of places to visit with total arrangements. The hotel also have various food plans rates, to suit your budget and taste.Cost wise the hotel is in medium group providing some where 3 star facility, but the hotel is maintained very well. In the indoor activity area they have lovey games so one can not feel bored. The Sterling Resort where we stayed for 7 days is definitely we recommend to our friend and is the place to keep visiting again and again.Thank you very much to The Sterling resort to give us a memorable leisure time.\n",

The hotel located at Phirni Rd, is at a fair distance from Mall Road, which lends it a serenity and calm, that you are trying to escape from the more commercial locations. Also, the duplex suite that we were in had a lovely view of the snow capped peaks. The service was excellent, and everybody in the staff was ever ready to help with a smile. The hotel desk also had a number of activities in late evenings that we enjoyed. My only grouse with the hotel is the lack of central heating. The hotel provided two portbale room heaters, but they were not good enough for the chilly nights we experienced during the stay.\n",

The resort is around 3 KM from bus stop. Taxi follows union rates of 150 Rs and auto charges 50 INR. It's one of the few branded resorts in Manali and hence reaching there is not a problem at all. The resort is built on a considerable free space and has two separate buildings - one for restaurant, reception, entertainment area; another for dwelling. There is an open lawn and a small garden. Suites are cozy and has a dry kitchen (coffe maker, microwave and fridge along with basic utensils). The TV is basic and has a Tata Sky connection. Bath room is clean and well maintained with good supply of linen rolls. Room service is prompt and staff always greets with smiling face. The best part is the restaurant. With large glass windows, wooden furnitures and high roof, it's look is distinctly colonial.The breakfast has south indian, continental and north indian menu and i found the preparations fresh and tasty. The non-veg items looked to be expensive and did not have any trout fish dishes. Through those large windows I could clearly see the manali peaks while having food. I did not avail adventure tours (rafting, biking, para gliding, treks) or evening programs conducted by Sterling. Overall it was a very good experience and I would like to stay there again. Though honestly had i not got the offer, I would have considered the rates (4700 / day) high and opted out.\n",

The resort is well-planned out with spacious wating area, a nice restaurant and a reasonable well-stocked activity room. The rooms are adequate with stunning views from some of them. The food selection provided in the restaurant was of a good variety, but the quality fluctuated a bit (taste-wise), probably because the chef was a new recruit (just had been employed 10 days previously, we learnt). The prices of the dish were extremely reasonable. The travel desk facilities, were very good, as we expect in Sterling Resorts. The location of the resort ensured that you could easily make day trips to Naggar, Solang valley, Rohtang pass, Vashisht or simply laze about the premises with the good book (borrowed from their library at a nominal cost) or play with your kids from an array of games available in the activity center - badminton, table tennis, carrom, cards, pool, etc.\n",

The food was nothing great but they did improve the breakfast spread based on our feedback. The hotel has a pool and a shop too. Its location is quite good- walking distance from the beach- where we preferred to have our meals at Roza's beach shack. Must try the prawn curry rice there. We also walked to Martin's corner from the hotel. The main center of Betalbatim is also walking distance from sterling hotel. The day we were to leave we had to sit through an hour long presentation about sterling holidays which was a bit irritating. Otherwise on the whole it was a pleasant experience.\n",

The property has got a beautifull and well maintained pool a nice bar and restaurant...it's even got a spa{ do book in advance as getting a slot may be a challenge}. Betalbatim beach is 10 mins on your foot and Martins Corner is 20 mins on foot. Beaches like Majorda, Utorda, Sunset are close neighbours and Colva is a rough 20 Mins on a bike. Getting Bikes and Taxis are very easy from the property as they follow published rates and the Bike Vendor/ Steve is a good guy offering good variety in rides and reasonable pricing!The Front End Staff and the Regional Manager was especially very courteous for both during the stay and post stay follow ups and feedbacks. Must say Sterling Properties has far exceeded my expectations post the Thomas Cook Buyout. Awesome Changes all throughout. Cheers!\n",

I was promised with an upgrade to the Pool Side Rooms, but alas, the property was full so I had to settle in the Guest Room.We were given room nos 220 and 221. Honestly, Once we entered the room, we asked for the House Keeping staff to come immediately. On insisting, they cleaned the room, and guess what, loads and loads of sand and dirt were found in the room. and to my surprise, the manager had told me that we clean all the rooms thoroughly before handing the room to the guest! anyways... after that we switched on the AC, but it was not functioning... we had to again call the house keeping, and they managed to switch it on after 15 minutes. later in late evening (at around 8 pm), when we were about to prepare the tea, we found that, there was already water in it ( i guess, the earlier guests must have left it). the tea pot was also not clean. when we informed the house keeping we were told that, after cleaning of the tea-pot, we keep water in it for next guests. (I was surprised) as I had never seen such a thing even in the best and worst hotels. We later went to the restaurant, and ordered only Pasta's (just to be sure of quality) and some sandwiches. Even they were cooked horribly, which we returned it back and were happy with the smallest sandwiches, which were served to us.in the mid-night, the AC of the room 220 started showering water. at first, I thought I am dreaming of rain, but suddenly, when I got up it was indeed Rains but from AC. so the AC had to be switched off for the whole night.They did repair the AC in the morning, but it had the same problem for the next night also, and we didn't have courage to complain again and again, as we had accepted the hospitality that way (worst hospitality) and even told ourselves, some days are bad so accept it.on 3rd evening, when we returned from outing, i was greeted by the manager on duty, and he was aware of all my problems, which I had faced. he told Sorry for the In-convinience, and even asked, what can he do to make it better, and I was like, I am anyways checking-out tomorrow, so why worry. lets face it... and even he said Thank you and left.So I guess, lets make sure, lets just avoid this property from next time and look for a better property in GOA.\n",

We had placed all of our bookings in South Goa at Villagio - A Sterling resort about 50 days in advance. The complete payment was made in advance by us. On the day we were supposed move from North Goa TO South Goa & check-in @ Villagio hotel, we received a call late in the evening from Villagio hotel manager - \"Manish\"(when our check-in time has already passed by 5 hours!!) who informed us that a complete block of the hotel is under maintenance as a result of which they wouldn't be able to provide us the rooms. We decided to go to Villagio Hotel to speak to the manager & sort out the matter. TO OUR SURPRISE (& SHOCK) WE FOUND OUT THAT THE BLOCK UNDER MAINTENANCE HAD BEEN ALLOCATED TO DEFENCE EXPO RESERVATIONS THAT WAS HAPPENING DURING THAT WEEK !!! The hotel management was FLATLY LYING on the maintenance reason. On learning this information we challenged Villagio staff to show us the block under maintenance. This request was again denied. So probably what happened is - Villagio Hotel Management gave our (& probably other folks) reserved rooms to some foreign customers who were willing to PAY MORE as a part of the block deal. The most disappointing thing here is the complete UNPROFESSIONAL & UNETHICAL hotel management that gave importance to earn MONEY rather than CUSTOMER LOYALTY. Villagio hotel offered us ONLY 2 properties in NORTH GOA. We again & again tried to explain to Villagio Hotel manager - \"Manish\" that all of 2 days activities were planned in South GOA. So North GOA was NOT a viable option for us. But he failed to understand this fact repeatedly. Only available option in South GOA was some 5 star properties that Villagio was NOT willing to compensate. Ultimately we had to search on our own and settle down for a hotel in Panjim. Again we had to do at least 30 - 40 follow-ups for getting the payment for this NEW hotel reimbursed with Villagio hotel management. Overall, our experience with Villagio in South GOA has been HORRIBLE. NOT only our entire trip plan was disrupted, the HOTEL management did NOT even have the courtesy to talk to us politely and follow up with us to check on the arrangement in the alternate hotel that we had booked.

Having stayed in North Goa for 3 days in our trip, the objective was to explore South Goa for the next 2 days with the itinerary already planned.It was on 27th march, the day of our booking at 5.30 pm when we were about to reach South Goa after travelling for 2 hours (North Goa and South Goa are far apart-min 2 hrs journey in traffic), that we were informed that we can’t be given the rooms citing some maintenance issues and instead will be provided accommodation in North Goa again in some 3 star property of our choosing vis-a-vis Villagio (so called 4 star).Amused as we were while travelling to Villagio we got 2-3 sms in a span of 2 hours recommending north goa properties with no verbal communication. For this we had to hire a van costing us 4000/- to travel to South Goa.On reaching the Villagio, the manager Mr. Manish found it our fault on why we could not take a downgrade north goa property despite giving the options over sms in a span of 2 hrs at the day of the booking. On top of it, this guy had the audacity to be insensitive to girls and blatantly rude while rejecting our confirmation. On enquiring a few guests who were staying there and the room service staff it was found out that there were no maintenance issues and instead the rooms had been provided to the dignitaries for the Defence Expo in South Goa hinting at the Political Hotel nexus thus ignoring the plight of common man. For all 10 of us, adjustment is not a big deal, we could have even settled for any equivalent property in South Goa, it was the insensitive nature of the management specially Mr. Manish who didn’t have the decency to talk politely to guests coming from a different city and settle the issue. At the end the booking instead was provided at Panjim (midway between north and south goa) for only 4 rooms with the promise to provide the refund of the 5th room and to honour the payment of these 4 rooms at the Hotel Tree House, Neptune on the next day. There was quite a lack of communication again from the side of the Villagio the next day in honouring the payment to the Hotel Tree House, Neptune with hotel staff pushing us again to convince Mr. Manish to release the payment.I urge fellow travellers to stay away from such Hotels in the future riding high on power nexus and discrediting its patrons.\n",

			"review" : "\nWe were given Studio rooms which was bigger than expectations has balcony and bath tubs. Our room was diagonally opposite to Reception. The beds and linens were nicely done. Gives you a business executive feeling unless you enter other corners of the resort. Pool is nice and well maintained. Food is an issue but I don't blame the team and chef as they are trained to make continental food. I am a north indian foody person. Not fond of any international cuisines. Sea food is a good option. However, please check prices before you order something different and get shocks or Cardio attacks while check out / paying bills. A glass of bournvita may cost you anywhere between 125 to 150 exclusive of taxes.Better to eat outside.Also I would recommend you to travel to Goa with your own vehicle. If that is not possible hire vehicle from people who are near the resort. Two wheelers would like Activa would cost you approx. INR 350 per day and additionally you need to fill fuel.Avenger or RE's will cost you approx. INR 450 or 500+ per day. They shall retain your original ID and give you vehicles on rent. Also try and not breakdown or make dents on the vehicle, as for Tourists like us Goa can become a nightmare.While returning to the resort late night we were caught by cops who checked our DLs but did not fine us for drink and drive. I would suggest not to try this as these days the regulatory bodies have become very strict. Please DO NOT DRINK and DRIVE.Villagio Inn did not have any activities or fun zones programs conducted by the resort. I have been to places where ideally DJ, Ghazal nights by the pool or Dinner is arranged by the resort, but here nothing of that sort. Did not observe any games too arranged for families.Complimentary options are Carom, Chess and Table Tennis. Pool is chargeable per board.In room dining and service available. Your in room fridge would be full of chocolates and Beers which is nice concept, but chargeable basis.Irene the resort manager and her staff was really helpful.However, trust me Sterling Holidays has better resorts at locations like Munnar, Kodai and Manali which have far better and appealing resorts and standards.Regards,Vinay\n",

For the amount I paid, I felt the stay was below average. It was shocking that the resort provides no toiletries. There is one gel which you use for shower and hair. There are no moisturizers or shower caps. the room service did not even wash the mugs which we used for coffee. There were no hand towels provided, nor there were any foot mats. Foot mats are a must in goa because of the sand which all around, and sticks to your legs. The room was large enough though which was a plus.  The buffet was expensive with 1 non veg dish and 3 veg dishes. A highly disappointing trip according to the expectations i had.\n",

We got shown to our room which I was very disappointed with as I had booked the superior room, the room we got given was very small - one large bed which you could just about walk around which then led you to the small bathroom. Fortunately, I had printed off all my bookings and there was a picture of the room I had booked which looked nothing like the room I was given.Due to this, I complained at reception and showed them the picture I had of the room we were supposed to be staying in. I was told that the room had been decorated that's why it looked smaller, very strange that a wall must have been knocked down also as in my picture there was furniture surrounding the bed. As he knew I wasn't going to fall for such nonsense he gave me another key to have a look at another room, which we did and liked - funny enough it was identical to the room I had booked and paid extra for!!So we didn't get off to a good start and it certainly didn't help seeing dirty plates and dishes on the stairs on the way to your room, lots of flies and mosquitos hanging around too.Our breakfast experience was awful, there wasn't much variety and the other guests -Indians (we were the only westerners) appeared very disgruntled that we were there.We didn't go near the pool because it was either full of families or mosquitos!I would never go back!\n",

Be safe with laundry it can get burnt and silently shoved into your cupboard. No irons in room. Like hell you need to ask for a milk water or tea replenishment. Lo behold your towel and linen wont be changed inspite of leaving on floor. If thats not enough you have to ask for eggs in a buffet breakfast. Rude waiters and room boys. Front office responds after 5 requests and the manager a gentleman named manish is always in a meeting. You may get an unresolved power cut. Dimly lit shabbily kept rooms with even the utility kit in toilet being replaced. They do not have slippers make sure you carry them after reading all this. We did warn them of this review hoping for an improvement..sad no change. Today have requested in writing for the basic dos in the front office ...more on that once I see whether they have acted on it. They are capable of incorrect billing and newspaper is inly given the first day. The muck cleared out if your room will remain on the staircase right outside your room. The furniture is a sham. The fruits on the table are complimentary and remain so for the three days of stay as they are not changed.

Our kid got a very bad scratch because of all this.2. The pool is good but the stairs to enter the pool are very bad ..... made of metal that will give you bruises on your foot. We also got hurt every time we tried to hold it.3. In the morning there was no hot water though we called the reception, nothing was done about it.4. The hand shower had all the coating coming out and if you are not careful you can have a bad scratch on your hand due to the sharp coating. 5. Food is just okay. But the staff is very rude. We have stayed in hotels that are at par with sterling where people help you with buffet breakfast. but here the staff flatly refuses to even guide you and asks you to manage yourself which was getting difficult with our small kid.6. Also the safe locker doesn't work.7. No amenities for the kind of money they charge. You can get better hotels in this area for that amount.This is some basic feedback with which you will get an idea of what to expect. Dont go by the name 'Sterling'.

A perfect place to dive to a deep sleep after whole day ride.People who ride own vehicle, please note that they DO NOT have a PARKING AREA. You will have to leave your car/bike some where in-front of the property. As we were riding on exotic bikes, we inquired for a safe parking for our bikes, where it would be noticed by the security. Then this guy Mr Bhaskar, some manager of the property entered the scene ad started the show. He was that arrogant and rude to us, at some point we felt we were asking him for a free stay there.

Very impressive. I did not see this at Club Mahindra!e. Calls for room service are not always picked up promtly. They need a dedicated line and person for room service phone calls.4. Activities:Movie screening in the open air restaurant is extremely loud and disturbs all nearby blocks tremendously!!It was a real pain on Friday (19th Feb) evening when the movie \"kick\" was screened. I had to use ear buds to get some peace in my room.All sterling resorts have TT tables, carrom, chess, board games etc which is great and reminds us of childhood days when the world was not so commercialised and materialistic as it is today. Club mahindra in contrast is pathetic!!!! Almost no free activities and lots of money making racket in holiday activities/water sports etc.5. Villagio Office:The office door is just next to the public washroom at the lobby and a hazard for people who walk in or out of the washroom. 6. Call divert:After 8 or 9 pm, calls to housekeeping etc get diverted to reception causing confusion. They need to take ownership of which staff which handle what in off-peak hours.7. Taxi service:Betalbatim has good drivers. I recommend Menino (+919850874054). He has an Ertiga and very decent driver. Has USB port but no Aux cable :-( for music. They charge same for small and large cars..so make sure you book before hand with your preferred driver & car or you will have to take the first one in the queue. Make sure you always look at the fare chart kept in the taxi or else ask for the fare chart.8. Walk to the beach: It's a short 10 mins walk with an amazing view of the fields!!........just before you reach Nanu beach resort. Do not miss this walk especially in the early mornings. It's refreshing and rejuvenating.It's a safe walk back to the resort even after sunset..it's safe even though a little lonely. Make sure you carry a foldable walking stick or umbrella as you will be bothered by stray dogs everywhere. An umbrella can be opened so it is a better deterrent.Overall experience at Sterling Villagio was good. Sterling is known for a very homely environment and courteous & down to earth staff. F&B especially was very kind. Francis and the F&B consultant, many more.Vivek at the front desk was very kind too.I think sterling has a management issue and hence they have been taken over by Thomas Cook. Despite the new management, staff is grossly underpaid (as compared to Club mahindra etc).But sterling staff is still very sweet.Guests at sterling are great! Very humble and down to earth...carrying no \"false\" attitudes or stereotypes.\n",

In a country like India, where we have taglines like \"Athithi Devo BHAVA\" , this type of service will only spoil the name of the Indian hospitality. We were not even attended properly and had to wait for 2 hrs to get our rooms. During this time, we weren't even offered water. Even after waiting for 2hrs, we 3 couples were given 3rooms in different blocks in spite of assuring us earlier that we will be given rooms adjacent to each other. While booking, it was shown that Wi-Fi facility is free. On our request of Wi-fi facility, they denied completely about the free service and told us that it is a paid service. This is a cheating done on their behalf for promoting themselves in Makemytrip. Our luggage was not attended by them and we had to carry it our self without the facility of lift. The rooms were not so clean and on demanding AC remote from the help desk, we were again made to wait till ages. In short, we can say that it is just a3 star hotel flaunting the name of 4 star.

Swimming pool is above 5ft and kids pool is tiny with 2.5ft.So, non swimmers can not really enjoy or relax in pool unless they are of 6ft height. My wish was not fulfilled in this regard. rooms are very spacious and clean. Nearest beach 1km walkable during day light. South goa famous Colva beach is 3km. Though Goa is friendly city, lone couple should be little brave to ride bikes at night in that area but definitely better than vagator and Anjuna beach areas of North goa. You have sufficient Street light on way to Colva beach, though it is secluded place. If you get a good deal price and alighting at Margao, Madgaon , it is a good choice, if you have your own or rented vehicle. You can avail rented bikes in either madgaon station or margao bus stand or Colva beach. Even travel desk of hotel can arrange but little costly. being a resort, it has recreation and games room. You can also rent a bicycle at hotel at 100 per hour. Try also candle light dinner at Colva or bathalbati beach side on any shack at night for memorable experience not too expensive than normal restaurants. Being a holiday resort rather than hotel, they will try to charge you for each and other auxiliary services like printing tickets etc.\n",

I usually don't write reviews about any places but this time they forced me to write so many good things about them. Right from the doorman(who kept saying Namaste every time he saw us:-) ) to the receptionist to the holiday activity center guys, restaurant people, every one ensured we had a great time while we stayed with them.A special mention of Mr. Bhim Singhji & his team who treated us like family and ensured we got to eat the best...hehehe.I also want to mention Mr. Satya ji (though I missed his magic show) and another gentleman(i never asked his name) who taught me glass painting.After staying at Sterling's property in north goa (btw I hated that place and people there) Villagio and their staff really impressed me. Although Villagio doesnt offer market areas or any other exciting stuff but I guess thats coz its the south of goa...hehehe, but it does have a beautiful beach at a walkable distance of 10-15 minutes.I am writing this peace to ensure other fellow vacationers like me don't end up biased about south of goa & sterling's property there.

			"review" : "\nAfter 2Nights at Club Estadia,we moved to Villagio that is located very close to BETALBATHIM beach near Colva.Resort has a nice elevation and amazingly big roomsThe Doorman from Odisha wore a perma-smile and I complimented him on that.Vishnoo at reception and Bellboy RIZVAN were so helpful. The room was so big witha small Living space and a beautiful balcony. The AC was finding it difficult to cool the room.The resort has the most picturesque Pool with waving palms,bamboo and a rowof PARADISE flowering plant lining two sides. When you float on the pool you feel this is BALI or PHILLIPINES. The Holiday Activities has a snooker table and colorful walls with cartoons and has a fine view of the pool thro a large glass window. BALRAM takes good care of the HA Admin and manages to satisy all guests including naughty boys who demand all sort of Electronic Games. We had Karaoke all 3nights and many guests sang old songs and thoroughly enjoyed themselves.Food was Fantastic. The Manager Mr.Singh tries real hard to to coax the guests to go in for Buffet Combos,but smailes when you order ala carte. Magendran does a great job with the F&B service. The Bar just outside the restaurant is so nicely designed that you can either swing on thier barstools or take a table by the poolsideThere is also a Boutique next to HA but rates are far from reasonable. there are many cycles but they dont work due to corrosion.The walk to Betalbathim Beach is highly recommended and goes past the huge NANU Resort....high class stuff! But once you are there,take a walk (25min) towards the left to Colva Beach and indulge in shopping for Miami type shirts and bikinis.Again the MINUS POINT is the TAXI/CABS outside the resort. They are here to LOOT and unless you want to walk with your luggage you have to submit to their Demands. The Resort staff simply helplessly look the other way...MERCI !!!!!Madgaon is just 8kms and one can get a bus if you walk 1km\n",

Being the monsoon, Goa was in its best greenery. The resort itself is serene and green, with beautiful rooms. The inhouse restaurant serves tasty goan food, but a bit pricey.The resort has a swimming pool & spa, and also has indoor activity room for kids.The only issue was with the sight seeing tours, as the taxi available outside the resort have their say on the rates, and you don't have much of an option but to avail their service. Another option can to be to rent a bike or a car.Good for family or groups who like spending time in the resort itself.\n",

Rooms are ok and staff are quite friendly and customer centric.Things that a visitor needs to be vary of b3fore deciding to stay here:1. There is no public transport that connects the village. If you do not have your own transport and one needs to move around there is no other option other than the tourist cabs which are quite expensive.2. There are no shops in the neighborhood to buy eatables or bread. One needs to travel 2-3 kms from the resort to get to the nearest store. Food in the resort's restaurant is expensive.3. Houses adjacent to the resort have pet dogs that can make you go sleepless at night.4. One house adjacent to the resort has cows and the stink from the cowshed can be unbearable at times.\n",

Resort has got a not so bad look. Front office staff is okay but not very helpful. Rooms are well maintained, bathrooms too and room service is worth mentioning. Holiday activities were good, but sight seeing trips got a problem since they arrange only taxi cabs and its our responsibility to deal with those people. They won't even talk with them, and land us in a place to discuss with those unknowns. Even at night they are of the attitude that taxis have to be arranged by us only. No pick up and drop facility available.

			"review" : "\nOur trip to the rest started in the middle of the week, in the middle of the rainy season. This should clearly be off-season but more on this a bit later.The arrival and checking in was a breeze. There was help available to get all our baggage (there were eight of us) to the rooms we had. The property is not too large, by any standard. However, it does have its advantages. The swimming pool, the events room and the restaurant are all in close proximity and all are quite enjoyable. The swimming pool starts from 4 feet depth (if I'm not wrong) and goes on till 6 feet. While its not too long, one can a few laps quite comfortably. The events room has a table tennis table, a pool (billiards) table and a carrom board. The TT table is quite decent, the pool table is also decent, although it is severely hampered on one side with lack of space as also the fact that there is no hand rest for shots where the cue ball is placed in a difficult position. The carrom board is really not worth bothering with and in my opinion, its only good use would be to chop it up for a nice bonfire.The restaurant has its good points. The food is really not bad, although it certainly isn't something a solid chef would be proud of - typical Indian restaurant fare. They do serve freshly cooked Indian breads (roti, naan) when having your meals. The dessert is something they need to make a serious effort at. What was served as dessert really did not fly with any of us (and we are not picky eaters).Sterling Resorts is a place where members should expect a decently priced vacation. Instead, we were charged a daily maintenance rate that was more than 60% of the going rate for the exact same facility on www.MakeMyTrip.com - and that rate included breakfast while we had to pay for it!Combined with the just-under-INR 700 a day breakfast-dinner combination, while being well thought of (this is a tourist place, after all) but not really well-priced, this is a tad difficult to justify for members who have invested what they have in this company. Remember, this was off-season. I can only imagine the in-season prices.In terms of location, this site is at a slight disadvantage - the other Sterling Resorts site in Goa is definitely more conveniently located - for visiting the more famous beaches in North Goa as also some interesting places such as Panjim city, Aguado Fort, etc. Also, there is no restaurant or shopping in walking distance from the facility. This can impact your taxi bill; which brings us to the next point to talk about.If you do not have your own conveyance, this facility has a perpetual set of taxis available outside their entrance. However, you must be aware of the racket that the taxi union runs in Goa. This is a huge setback to visiting Goa - but is obviously not something that the facility itself has any control over. Going anywhere (other than the Betalbatim beach, which isn't anywhere on the scale while comparing with the other beaches of Goa) is a costly affair, as there is no meaningful public transport in this part of Goa.The one thing that redeems this facility is truly the excellent service from the staff there. Everyone is truly invested in helping you make the most of your time there. The events manager, the restaurant manager and the property manager are all very eager to please you and will go out of their way to make your experience a special one.Overall, Sterling Resorts Villagio is a very decent choice to make for your next trip to Goa - just remember that there is a price for everything - so perhaps, in retrospect, we will visit the other Sterling facility in Goa during our next trip there.\n",

The Buffet in breakfast was very good for those who like American breakfast with South-Indian combination. Both are my favorites and Buffet dinner is OK taking into consideration of menu choose. Activity room is also loaded with many games and only pool and cycling is chargeable and that too is very nominal. The swimming pool costume is must to enter swimming pool which is what we missed due to unavailability of swimming costume with us.Overall the experience was very good and staff were very co-operative.Note:- If you make your travelling arrangement before reaching resort, you will save much money as resort is around 8km towards inside from KTC bus stand( Main Bus Stand) and there is no public transportation available inside. Resort management and private taxi charge exorbitant money. We were only two people so hire a bike from opp. Bus stand and them went to Resort, If you have come to take rest and go to only beaches your total travel will not more than 50km in three days and visiting 10 nearby beaches & Hotels. BIke rent 350 per day due to long weekend can get in even less price.\n",

I believe a Goa trip should consist of only beaches, bars & pool...and Villagio is just the place for it. The rooms were excellent and so was the rest of the hotel. The activity centre kept the kids engaged while we adults enjoyed the bar and restaurant. The staff was friendly and warm. The drawbacks of the hotel include some majors like room service and restaurant service. Room service is poor i must say though the staff seemed very polite and prompt. But everything came with extra price, like water and coffee/tea, etc. Usually in hotels esp the star rated ones offer complimentary water and sachets of tea/coffee for the room. But here they provide just 2 500ml water bottle and 2 sachets of coffee/tea for the whole day. And if one wanted more then they have to order the full pack and not just tea or coffee. Which i found was ridiculous. Same goes with the water as well.Now the restaurant, they serve amazingly delicious food but the it takes equally unbearably long time to serve the order. Sometimes the waiter forgets to bring all that is ordered. If he does remember then probably the quantity is too little. The first couple of times we let it go but then it became a regular thing. Last we insisted we wanted to speak to the manager but that person seems non-existent. Every time we asked to meet him we were told he has left. So in short what lacks in that restaurant with probably the best cook in goa is a good manager.\n",

This property is about 10minutes walk from Betalbatim beach which is a nice less crowded beach close to Colva beach in South Goa. The welcome and the registration was easy and the receptionist was very helpful. The Property entrance could be made little bit much nicer though .We stayed in thier studio apartment rooms which has a spacious Bedroom and a living room and a balcony. The upholstry was kind of rundown due to poor maintenance. The Housekeeping staff was very slow and had to be reminded several times for refilling water, towels, toilet rolls etc.The Hotel Restaurant was just OK and gets cramped if we had more than 10 families dining at same time. The food menu was unimpressive and the taste just average compared to other Sterling properties. The service was too slow and we had to request several times to refill the buffet counter dishes.The pool was maintained well and they had a good recreation room for the kids. The Hotel organized various events which keeps the family engaged during the dinner times.It would be nicer if the facilties could provide bicycles for rent for getting small general items and pharmacies as this property is far away from general stores.I was also disturbed at 3 AM in the Night saying that some sound is coming from our apartment floor but then they told us sorry and left. They should have made sure about the source of sound before disturbing the guests.\n",

We were a family of 4 adults and 2 Kids, and we had requested for adjacent rooms and though it was a long weekend Ms Saswati Gogoi was kind enough to accept our request by providing both Studio Apartments... Well more than a 'Studio Apartment' it was more of a 1 Bed, Hall Room with a huge Hall and an equally big Balcony and it had all the aspects of a 5 Star property. We were very happy with the pampering received by the resort. The rooms were well ventilated as well, and since this is in a secluded place,its quite secure and quiet as well.This hotel has quite knowledgable front desk and they have the most knowledgable security personnel Mr Sushant Sahhu who knows 5 Languages including Russian, Swedish, Ukrainian etc., and knows the state in the back of his palm and is able to help every guest with a big smile written on his face.It has a well maintained pool and also a decent indoor game area... The best part is it is close to one of the most secluded 'Betalbatim Beach' which is less than a 10 minute walk, where we can have all the privacy and also a great places for sunset. The Beach has quite a few 'Beach Shacks' as well. The property is also within 3.5 km from Colva Beach where one can go for various activities including Parasailing, Dolphin Sight Seeing etc., For the die hard vegetarians there is Sagar Kinara Restaurant which is close to the Colva Beach.Overall this was a very enjoyable experience for us as a family.\n",

Away from crowds , this betalbatim beach and the resort is best place for anyone who needs to have a pleasant peaceful vacation. On second day of our visit, we have planned to visit North Goa(Baga beach) but regretted after visiting the place as it was too much crowd on new year day. New year eve dinner at resort was nice one. There is a restaurant named Martin corner nearby to the resort(around 1.5km) which was really good. Had awesome ambiance typical to Goa and food was also good.Resort restaurant is decent. But cost is slightly on the higher side. Swimming pool is clean and well maintained.Shacks in beaches nearby to resort is also good. There are watersport activities also in those beaches.Cons:Resort should take care or atleast help customers for 2 wheeler or 4 wheeler rent/hire. As we were charged Rs.1000 per day for 2 wheeler which is crazy. But as the place was remote we had no choice. Reason we were told is it's peak time and hence charge is high.\n",

Beach is at 10 minutes walk-able distance, Excellent accommodation for People looking for less crowded and serene places. Clean and clear beach,frequented mostly by foreign travelers.

Food quality is nice. Housekeeping, front office and restaurant staff were well mannered. Clean swimming pool for kids and adult persons.Hotel Negatives - There is no lift, avoid rooms on top floors, food is costly, you are handicapped if you do not have vehicle, travel guys outside the hotels are fleecing the customers. I visited on year end ( 28th to 31st Dec) and had to pay multiple times the usual rental.Restaurant was grossly under staffed, Poor guy was running to get the orders at restaurant especially at dinner time.Visit during off season for better room discounts and affordable vehicle on rent.

			"review" : "\nThis is a very basis and average hotel. Should not be classified as a resort though. Around 10 min walk from the betalbatim beach. The location is pretty secluded and away from the hustle bustle of the main city. One cannot hire a self driven car in this area. You need to either have your own (owned) car or 2 wheeler or else you are at the mercy of the pvt taxis which are there just outside the property. Bargain as much as possible since these people will rip you apart with the prices. Try and go to the main betalbatim village (around 10-15 min walk) and hire a taxi from there to get a better bargain. Been told by one of the taxi drivers that self driven cars are not allowed in South Goa, unlike North Goa. We got hold of a taxi driver named Bonny (9923668523). He was a nice guy and charged lower than others. Recommended. ROOMS: The rooms are large and well kept. They don't even provide bathroom slippers. Overall the property was neat and tidy. Swimming pool also looked clean, though we didn't step onto it. FOOD: No complains. We are vegetarian and were fully satisfied with the food options and the quality. Our package was including all 3 meals and we got sufficient options for veg dishes in b/fast, lunch and dinner. Had read previous reviews wherein people had commented regarding high price of the food. But seeing the menu card, I think its reasonable. There are 4 floors and no lift. We had an infant with us and were carrying a baby stroller, so requested for a room on lower floor, but was not given. The activity room, is just for namesake, Its extremely small and packed. The pool game was chargeable. Games and activities should not be chargeable though. Beach: Betalbatim beach is just 10 min walk from the hotel and the beach, is very neat and clean and mostly foreign tourist could be seen. There are around 5-6 shacks on the beach. We visited other beaches like Cavelossim,Benaulim and Mobor. All were beautiful, unspoiled, neat and clean. Completely opposite to their north counterparts. ATTRACTIONS: Martin's Corner (around 10-15 min walk) is a nice place where one can spend the evening. Its very lively. Ample food options for Veg as well. One can also go to \"My Kind of Place\", very near to Martins Corner. Wifi is chargeable. Overall a decent experience. Nothing very great, nothing very bad. Not a resort in any way though. The only thing it hurt staying there was the huge expenses on Taxi. But I believe so will be the case anywhere in South Goa.\n",

There is the clean and unadulterated beach at Betalbatim within a walkable distance of Sterling Villagio, where you can while away your time. You can also play in the swimming pool which is clean and well maintained. As far as food is concerned,you can enjoy your choice out of the menu spread out in buffet for dinner and breakfast.There was a fantastic Sitar Recital during dinned on the second day of our stay. The service at Villagio is quite good and quick too. If you want to go out for sight seeing, there are plenty of taxis available right outside, but you have to bargain otherwise the taxis will take you literally for a ride as far as fares are concerned. On the whole, our stay at Sterling Villagio was comfortable and we enjoyed our stay there.A couple of suggestions to Sterling: Activity Room is too small and cramped. Strering should do something about it so that all those using it can relax. Further, the billing process at the Restaurant and Reception needs to be speeded up.\n",

Since, it was an official offsite, I will not be able to comment on the price. However, my colleagues have said that we got a pretty good deal for a full-board stay at the hotel. Now, coming to the hotel. The hotel was a lovely place to stay in Betalbatim. It has lovely layout ensuring that each room is not far away from the in-house restaurant and pool. The pool is a medium sized pool that is clean and the hotel also has a games room. The best aspect of the hotel was the rooms. We stayed a room that was near the pool. It was a huuuuuuge room that had two balconies-one overlooking the balcony and the other overlooking the garden of the next door. The room was just like a 5 star hotel, cosy, comfortable and clean and one could just spend time relaxing in the room. The bathroom was also the star, it was huge and spotless.Being in Betalbatim, we ate at the Villagio's in house restaurant and the food was good, nothing to right home about. I have to make a special mention to two restaurant staff - Ashish and Vandana, they were always extremely polite and extremely helpful and also quite friendly to all of us. In fact, almost all the staff at the hotel was nice and friendly. The beach is just a five minute lovely picturesque walk away. Being in Betalbatim, you have to go to madgaon for shopping and eating at other restaurants.In short, the Goa Villagio is a lovely hotel to stay with the family, if you are not looking for hectic travelling and site seeing and looking at spending more time with the family.\n",

A very good place to visit in group.\n",
